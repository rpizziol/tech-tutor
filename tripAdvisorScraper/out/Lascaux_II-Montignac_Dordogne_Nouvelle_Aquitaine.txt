Comment: I'm so glad I went to Lascaux II.  With the opening of IV, II may be playing out the string.  It is getting a bit tatty around the edges, physically, but it still was just wonderful.  A couple days earlier, my wife and I were blown away by Pech-Merle.  So we had seen original cave art in the actual cave.  I wanted to see Lascaux because I had heard it described as the "Sistine Chapel" of cave art.  It is.II is the result of over a decade's worth of scrupulous reproduction and recreation of the original cave - at least, the main portion of it.  It is a very convincing replica.  The tour guide greatly enhanced the experience.  I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job than he.  He really made the art and the techniques come alive.  You very quickly forget this is a replica and just bask in the art.  He patiently answered all our questions.  He was informed (his book is in the bookstore) and funny.  And, again, patient.  Do make the effort to have a tour in a language you understand.  If I had not had an English-speaking guide, much would have been lost.I won't even attempt to describe the wall and ceiling art.  It's simply breathtaking.  Modern, abstract, impressionistic, enigmatic, but mostly just beautiful.  I wondered about what I had seen for days.  As our guide stated, we have researched so many aspects of this cave art - the techniquest, the materials, the age - but he wonders, as do I, why did they do it?  Why go so far into caves with one-hour (at best) lamps, with scaffolding (!), that was not readily observable.  I'm still wondering, except maybe it was just to create something beautiful for the appreciation of someone/something other than people.  In any case, it's a wonder and I think I appreciated it more in the low-tech atmosphere of II than I would have at IV.Read more

Comment: I admit that the young kids in the family didnt appreciated the astonishing wall paitings and were amused more of the dark cave, but for my husband and me it was a remarkable experience and even an exciting one. It is a unique place you won't just bump into in other place-which makes it a "must" site. Read more

Comment: Great experience visiting the site. It is a copy of the original cave, but it looks very real.The tour starts with an explanation of the site and the discovery process. it is interesting for all visitors from small children to elderly adults - except for those afraid of closed spaces. The explanations are interesting and given in several languages - you need to book before and check for the best language for you.Read more

Comment: You can read about this art, but the actual experience of seeing the detailed composition and colors drawn by humans 20,000 years ago gives me goosebumps.  II is a meticulous reproduction of the original grotto, so the number of daily visitors is large.  We had an art student as guide this last time who provided interpretations dominated by artistic styles, although he was reluctant to provide in interpretations of the lives of the artists that we have heard from anthropology and archaeology students.Read more

Comment: We loved the rustic setting and walking up to the original cave for the discovery story before entering Lascaux II.  Our guide was informative and entertaining. He presented in a way that felt fresh and enthusiastic. The paintings are unbelievable - so much more detailed and numerous than expected. This was a fabulous experience that should not be missed.Read more

Comment: This was the highlight, for me, of our trip through France.  This was a total reproduction of the original cave. The original cave paintings were being damaged by heat, light and people’s breath (carbon dioxide). Paintings in Lascaux II were done using the same pigments and techniques, and took 11 years to complete. The original cave is dated to 15-20,000 years ago. The largest animal was 5 meters by 1.50 Meter- an aurochs. Many paintings were 3-dimensional, and some animals were shown appearing or leaving the scene. Perspective was also used- for example horses getting smaller as going into distance.Read more

Comment: We visited both Lascaux II and Lascaux IV.  IV first which made us want to go back in and visit again but the booking office recommended Lascaux II to try for a new experience which was a fabulous choice hence I am going to comment on both sites in this review to give a complete picture.  Lascaux IV is in the main building and covers 95% of the original paintings.  The tour is an hour.  You are given a gadget to use at the end of the tour to use in the 'museum' after your visit to the caves.  This explains amongst other things, how the replica was made, the layers of animals, paints used, explanations as to what the paintings mean and heaps of other interesting facts including videos.  You have to use all of the buttons on the gadget otherwise you miss out on a lot of this information (Make sure you remember this as we were were not told this on our guide and would have missed heaps).As you are only in the actual caves of IV for an hour, you get a very high level (albeit good) review from the guide, however once you have been through the 'museum' (we were in there three hours), you understand so much more and you want to go back in and see the paintings again (unfortunately you can't unless you buy another ticket).With this in mind, we booked Lascaux II (if you book a second visit, your ticket price is reduced to 6 Euros per adult) and Tatiana our English speaking guide was phenomenal.  She bought Lascaux II alive for us.  She talked about the characters involved in the discovery of the caves and we learnt so much more (especially as we'd already been in Lascaux IV and now understood what we were looking at).  Tatiana gave us the human element with so much more explanation and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her.For us both sites of Lascaux were breath-taking.  Lascaux IV is about getting the facts and Lascaux II for us, was about getting the feeling and bringing it to life.Huge thank you for sharing such an amazing piece of pre-history with us.Read more

Comment: Took friends on supposed 'english speaking guide' tour. Unfortunately the guide was awful- his english was really bad, he waffled on about irrelevant stuff, but missed many of the key points to cover and he was rude to the visitors for talking (which they were doing amongst themselves to try and understand what he was supposed to be saying!)I live locally and have done this tour many times- both in english and french. Guide quality has varied a little in there past, but this guide was the worst I've ever experienced by far. His vocabulary was probably not bad, but his pronunciation was so poor that he was impossible to understand (I am used to a french accent and it was not just that). In our group we had native french, me (english born but live in France and speak good french), english, americans, new zealanders and dutch. None of us could understand him. One american asked him a question and the guide said 'he should have been listening as he had already answered that'. The client said he had been listening, but politely said he was struggling to understand the guide. He was then asked 'where he came from' and when he said America, the guide said 'he was speaking english not american'. I can confirm he was not speaking anything that most english could understand! Real pity that Lascaux doesn't just empty guides who speak good english- there are loads of locals who have it as their first language who would make the tour so much more informative and fun for clients. I certainly won't be taking any more friends visiting us there again in a hurry!Read more

Comment: Four of us spent a week exploring France this September. The cave at Lascaux was one of the highlights. While it is a reproduction, it is as real as the original must have been. And because it is a reproduction, the lighting was better than some others.  After the tour there is a gallery with yet another set of reproductions that can be photographed. Of all the caves I rate this highest.Read more

Comment: So... you're not going to see the REAL Lascaux... that's been closed to the public for decades but this place is so well done that you won't really miss it that much.  Our guide was fantastic and the facsimile cave is really just beautifully done.  They've created a space that really feels like a cave.  We visited some other caves in the Dordogne but the artwork in Lascaux is breathtaking.  No photos inside but there are some opportunities after the tour before you hit the gift shop.  Wear sensible shoes/tennis shoes and you might need a light jacket.Read more

Comment: This recreation of the Lascaux caves is in the same spot as the actual caves, on a quiet leafy hill, away from the gleaming museum Lascaux IV. The work that went into making these caves is incredible and the guided tour is absolutely essential for getting the most out of the experience. There is one English tour a day (when I went in June at 3 pm). Purchase your ticket on line in advance in the summer--they sell out, especially the English tour. The art is breathtaking and to think what our prehistoric ancestors went through to create such stunning art took my breath away. I also loved the peaceful setting and the effort the guides take to really give you the experience of being in the original cave. If you are in the Dordogne, this is a must see. great for kids too.Read more

Comment: This was a very interesting visit with an English speaking guide who made things come to life very well. The cave is a copy of the original, but is dark whilst the guide lights the images with a torch. Being elderly, our group were warned that the entry to the centre had steps but no hand rail. Exiting the caves and more steps to climb. Forest very humid, steps made from Rail sleepers and a bit of concrete. Unfortunately there was no hand rail and some of the wood was a bit rotten and gave way causing me to slip backwards and tear a muscle or something similar.The guide from the centre got an ambulance and I was whisked off to hospital. Not too much harm done. I think the lack of a handrail didn't help.Read more

Comment: A wonderful experience - it’s incredible to think that these paintings were completed 20k years ago and survived ! The scale of the paintings was spectacular - apparently scaffolding was needed by the prehistoric people who painted these. Range of colours was impressive - 15 in total!The cave and drawing replica in Lascaux II is beautiful and awe inspiring - totally worth a visit when you’re in the Dordogne.Tip - we had tried to get into Lascaux IV for the 4 o clock English tour but were too late - suggest you book well ahead - it’s a relatively small cave so capacity is limited. Tip - Our guide in Lascaux II did the tour in French and summarised each part in English for us which was v helpful. I also bought a guide book in English to help with our understanding of what we were experiencing !Read more

Comment: This is an unbelievable experience.  The original caves were discovered during WWII.  The caves that we now see have been replicated using the original techniques.  The experience is magnificent and the clarity just blows our minds. These were done by very early, 17,000 years ago.  The beauty of the animals is awesome.  This is so worth the visit.Read more

Comment: Better than Lascaux IV, which has become sort of a Disneyland, this one is worth seeing. Try to go in October or so when not so many people will also try to go. Also: if your sense of balance is challenged as is mine, hold hands with someone - it's very dark, the floor is sloped in funny ways, so your innate sense of balance is critical.Read more

Comment: The whole experience was spellbinding. It's a very special place. We had booked our tour and an English speaking guide by e-ticket in advance and he spoke clearly, took care with the participants and described all aspects of the geography, discovery and factors surrounding the "prehistoriques" and their paintings. Questions were answered. An earlier reviewer must have been unlucky on his only average visit as we would unreservedly recommend for all ages from age 10 upwards. Not been? - then put it on your must do list and tick it off as soon as you can!Read more

Comment: This tour needs to be undertaken in your host language to fully absorb the cultural, spiritual, technical and sheer unparalleled beauty of OUR European ancestors. Likely black skinned these fully skilled hunter-gatherers armed with fire, food and shelter in the post-glacial tundra had a sublime artistic vision with a very limited pantone colour range in this limestone cave. No blues or greens yet discovered in their world.Representations of bulls, horses, Aurocs, deer, ibex create a vivid theatre in the darkness their life-life representations (all are celebrated living) are 17,000 years old. The ultimate dream of every 14 year old - finding a secret cave untouched may not be the only hidden secret of the wide expanse of central France. It took a lost dog in 1940 to reveal an insight into this long lost civilisation. Surely some external influence (my bet is very powerful mushrooms) must have played their part to have given these gifted artisans the visual stimulation to create these masterpieces in a unique cathedral long before the Parthenon friezes in Athens and alongside the Australian cave-art. Go there NOW : and see for yourself - Thanks to Pascal whose wide ranging English language explanation or interpretation has raised more questions in this humble visitor.Buy online in advance - print the e-ticket and climb the long hill to Lascaux II - a pilgrimage ignoring the visitor centre on the left on the way out of Montignan.  There is a chance to take walk up a track past the original cave entrance (much abused from the 40's to the 60's) from the car park - on the way to a far older Paleolithic tomb site on top of the hill through a canopy of horse-chestnut and oak trees.Don't worry about wi-fi - you really won't need any distractions here.Read more

Comment: Lascaux II is up the hill from the big Lascaux museum, so if you are driving be sure to keep driving all the way up the hill to the public parking lot.  While the museum is striking, the site of Lascaux II is intimate, quiet, natural.  And then the tour starts and suddenly we were thrown back 20,000 years into the past.  They've done such an AMAZING job of replicating the actual (and yet no longer approachable) original cave.  The guide did a magnificent of telling the full story of the caves past and present history.  But more importantly, he gave us different perspectives on what we were viewing, which allowed us to ponder what our forebears had been up to.  A truly memorable experience.Read more

Comment: What an incredible place.  We were spellbound by the whole experience.  LASCAUX 2 is the best place to visit for an authentic experience. The guide was amazing and gave us a incredible personal insight into the cave and its history. The whole family were speechless when we saw the paintings and didn't want to leave. This is well worth a visit but be careful which cave you book to see. We passed the new visitors centre which looked very modern and clinical in comparison. Read more

Comment: Lascaux II is the original replica of the Lascaux Cave. Lascaux (or Lascaux IV) is the new international centre with a more complete replica opened in December 2016. I remember Lascaux II as a more authentic replica and experience (visiting the cave using hand held torches) but the new replica is brilliant with modern technology to aid the visit.On the day I visited, many people, including myself, had booked Lascaux II but went to Lascaux. The website is confusing.  I managed to change my tickets. Personally I would go for Lascaux.Not to be missed. Read more

Comment: What an amazing experience! Incredibly knowledgeable and friendly guide. Felt very very authentic, although I am well aware this is a replica cave; it really does not feel like it. Take advice from other reviews- lascaux2 is not the international visitors centre and you do not go to the international centre. Most of our tour were late because they had gone there instead. Drive past the actual international centre and you will come to a tiny roundabout signed lascaux2- its just up there.The guide mentioned they may be stopping visits next year due to the new big centre: I would highly recommend you go before it gets shut- it is really quite breathtaking Read more

Comment: 20,000 years ago! The term cave man is not what we think it is given the quality, standard and content of these drawings and paintings. Given they need to preserve the originals this tour is a copy they have done it in a sympathetic way to give you the most genuine experience. Its definitely worth the visit, and it will leave you thinking 'why couldn't I make a discovery like this when I was a kid?'Read more

Comment: This cave (Lascaux II) is located adjacent to the original cave. The painting in the cave date from around 17000 BCE. It is believed that after the drawings were completed the cave collapsed and was sealed until it was discovered in 1920. In order to preserve the original cave, the drawings were replicated in the new cave that was built. The original cave is closed to the public. It is amazing to realize that these drawings were completed with minimal lighting and limited tools and pigments. It gives us a picture of the culture during that period. It is worth a trip if you are in the area.Read more

Comment: I am     a    caver  professional geologist and so my  evaluation is based n    persrrsonal professional experience and   as s disabled tourist   my   main    negativity iste complexity of booking required by a separated visit to the booking office  in the towwn of Montignac , which fragments the nature of the visit. Lascaux   2 is a fake [  should say replica/ facsimile, the real   Lacaux is too vulnerable to damage and too precious to be a  tourist attraction    Therefore   Lascaux 2 is  a reproduction of the environment of the real cave .it is astonishing   had I not known that  it was  not the real cave neither  my    caving  expertise nor my   geological training would have alerted   to me that it was a reproduction. The   verisimilitude is aided by the facility actually being  recreated in a  series of buried and artificially created   chambers the micro scale reproduction/ replication  ofthe rock wals as well as the   cave paintings coupled witthethermal characteristics of the underground environment make it utterly convincing. It is not   really amenable to disabled access though  as  am still able to walk  a little I was able to appreciate the entirety of the     facility.    handrails  certainly help  the movbility-impaired everything here is remarkable and  stupendously worth a visit.  forte  geologist specialising in Quaternary ice ages te   [paintings & their implications for hominid evolution are remarkable   but almost  as or more remarkable than  the    importance of the site, I would say the methods and success in receatingthe replica is as   remarkable an interesting a feature for the visitor to witness. the guides were well-informed and   well-trained specialists in the field of  Quaternary archaeo-geologyRead more

Comment: Haven't been to Lascaux IV so can't compare, but Lascaux II is amazing. We had a well-informed guide with very good, charmingly accented English. She took us up the forested hill to see the entrance to the original cave, then did a fine job of explaining how the reproductions were made, as well as how the original pigments and artwork came to be, as far as can be known. Then she escorted the group into the main chamber by torch light, as it was discovered. Very effective. The lighting came up and she went into great detail about each section of the cave. It was truly a fabulous experience.Read more

Comment: We took a guided tour of the "replica" cave . The real cave has been closed to the public for many years - since the 1970,s. Our guide for the English speaking tour was Anthony- he did an excellent job, presenting a coherent and staged story of the history and the artwork. We began with a walk up to the top of a hill to see the entrance to the real cave. He told us about how it was discovered . Then we entered the replica cave. In The first two rooms we were introduced to the dim light conditions and Anthony provided explanations about the size and layout of the cave , the conditions, the source of paint,  the style of painting etc and information about cro magnum man . We entered the replica cave and saw the paintings , just as if we were in the real cave. Anthony's elaborations of the artwork were informative.Overall an excellent experience . We booked online the day before the tour .it cost thirteen euros per adult. The tour lasted one hour and fifteen minutes.It is very cool in the cave so bring a sweater . It was about twelve degrees.

Comment: There are quite a few caves in the Vézère valley that boast prehistoric cave paintings. Lascaux II is the cave to see. You go to the others because the paintings are prehistoric. You go to Lascaux II because the paintings are extraordinary. After seeing Lascaux, Pablo Picasso is said to have muttered: ‘We have invented nothing’. I'm not sure that's true, but can understand why he said it. On the same trip, we also visited the Grotte de Rouffignac, the so-called "Cave of 100 Mammoths." No comparison. Yes, what you actually get to see at Lascaux II is only a replica, to protect the original from degradation. But I doubt that anyone not an expert in prehistoric art would be able to tell the difference. Even my 14-year-olds were impressed, awed, and delighted.Read more

Comment: You cant fail to be impressed by the re-creation of the 17,000 year old cave paintings - and the new building is interesting too, but for the admission to be more expensive then the Louvre in Paris or the Uffizi in Florence is ridiculous!  The new museum  is the Emperor's New Clothes - lots of nothing to see - €70million of space and light - much like the €14million PreHistory Centre in Les Eyzies. The 3D movie (in French) is weird, with a terrible voice-over, which makes your specs vibrate its so deep!!  Overall its an enjoyable 90 minutes, but for our small party to spend almost 100€ for an morning's diversion is just too much - €10 per adult is plenty!!Read more

Comment: We were a bit apprehensive about a visit to LASCAUX ( no more  1,2,3,4!) the spanking new complex built into the famous hillside site, but were very glad that we made the effort. Unfortunately, staying some kilometres away ( and it's not so easy to find!) we arrived at lunchtime to find that there was no afternoon guided visit in ENGLISH! However, with the modern technology this was not a major problem for us wit some French within our grasp!The clever audio-visual tablet guide ( with camera) allows you to follow the tour itinerary and listen to the guide at the same time! The reproductions of the cave paintings are spectacular, and the fact that it is all a very accurate representation of the whole of the original cave complex. ( rather than only 70% in the earlier Lascaux 2) doesn't seem to matter . Afterwards , you have more "hands on" copies,simulations and loads of smart audio- visual material which must be great for demanding kids an experts alike.The complex itself is beautifully designed, but I would hazard a guess that it will struggle at peak summer times! The multi lingual audio- visual tablet style  electronic guide could probably be refined to eliminate the need for a personal guide other than to keep visitors moving at peak times, and the catering facilities really need to come more into the 'Electronic Age'Overall though a good experience.Read more

Comment: A visit to Lascaux II was undoubtedly a highlight of our trip through France. We had booked ahead for an English language tour and found ourselves in the company of about 25-30 other people and a French guide who clearly loved her job and brought the history of the cave's discovery, its subsequent history and the creation of this amazing replica, to life. Once inside, it's hard to imagine that you are not in the real cave (part of the Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley World Heritage Site), which is sited close by, so real are the replica cave paintings. Even the ambient temperature is the same as the actual cave. One cannot but feel moved at the majesty of the art work which was created around 17,000 years ago; our ancient forebears captured the form of the animals that surrounded them with such vibrancy and attention to detail, including a sense of perspective that alluded artists until relatively modern times. I was as interested in the science of how the replica was excavated and how its paintings were recreated using authentic tools and pigments, as I was about what purpose and meaning the artwork had in the Upper Palaeolithic. Forty minutes flew by and it was with great reluctance that I exited the cave. I understand that a new visitor attraction, Lascaux IV, has now opened. A surefire excuse (if one was ever needed to visit the Dordogne) to return to Montignac.Read more

Comment: Whilst waiting for the possibility to review Lascaux 4 (soon just to be called 'Lascaux') I post a review on the Lascaux 2 page. This new site is world class. A splendid building that blends into the hillside. Inside houses the breath taking replica of the whole cave, as opposed to Lascaux 2 which covers a reduced area. But there is so much more with what is somewhat confusingly called your 'companion de visite'.  This is a tactile and very clever tablet, including a camera, and not a human! The day of opening there were quite a few glitches no doubt to be resolved quickly. With this guide you can learn so much more about prehistoric art and appreciate the finest details of engravings. For me I just cannot wait to go back again. Whereas 16 euros seems expensive as the entry charge, it is in reality a true bargain. In short an amazing site hopefully a more than once in a lifetime experience.Read more

Comment: We visited the site aware that in a very few days time the new site would be opened amid much fanfare and that the building in which it will be housed is a modern and super attractive statement in itself.  Just two kilometres away up the hill and amid the surrounding forest is the first replica site Lascaux II and frankly it is all the more moving for the simplicity of its situation.  We have very little French however timing did not permit the luxury of waiting for an English speaking guide but that really didn't matter.  We had done a deal of reading beforehand and the pictures are of such moment and force that they tend to speak for themselves.  What I hadn't quite anticipated was the amazing artistic talent displayed by the artists of between 17 and 19 centuries ago and, in particular, their extraordinary use of light and shade, perspective and the topography/contours of the cave walls and ceilings.  The 40 minute tour seems like10 minutes and at the end it is quite a moving experience.  To emerge into the forest is in our view appropriate and may in fact be more relevant than the new display but that is for others to say.  Whatever the answer I'm glad that we saw it as it presently stands.Read more

Comment: After reading umpteen reviews about the pros and cons of this replica cave, I decided to bite the bullet, having already visited Grotte de Rouffignac, and give Lascaux II a chance because it is so famous and is going to close as I understand when Lascaux IV opens.  We booked the English speaking tour.  I suppose if you have not visited a real cave beforehand, then this site would be more impressive, but it simply does not feel like a real cave nor does it provide them same experience and ambiance, not to mention the tour is incredibly short for the price - when we exited my kids and I looked around in amazement when we entered into the light like "that's it? We were just getting into it...".  The guide God bless him for trying to speak English and explain complicated terms had a thick accent which made it hard to understand and he spoke at times too low and too quickly, flashing his light over what were supposed to be educational details too quickly to follow his explanation, and grasp their meaning thus diminishing the experience, as some would say in a scripted way.  My kids who are 11 and 9 lost interest after the first part due to this.  Yes, this is all because of how little time they allow between groups, so the guides have to cover it all quickly, not their fault. The paintings themselves, if you imagine them in the real Lascaux cave, are still impressive. Again, if you have NOT visited other caves, they would seem more impressive. I do admire the effort it took to make this replica - 11 years of work on the art using the same materials, but it is just not the same as the real thing. Particularly when the first of the three caverns visited consists of exhibits, not paintings, more for instruction about how the cave was made rather than actual paintings.  Hopefully management learns from such feedback and improves the experience with Lascaux IV.  As a side note, if you have children who are small and will have trouble keeping quiet, you will be stressed out, they will distract from the already quiet and hard to follow tour much to the dismay of those around you. Better to go on one that has a train like Rouffignac.Read more

Comment: We remembering reading about Lascaux when we were youngsters, MANY years ago (in my case), and were always intrigued by it.  The original cavern has been closed to protect it, so this is a reproduction.  It was as incredible as we had hoped, and we never felt disappointed not to be seeing the "real thing".  We know only a little about art and less about art history, but we always thought that masters like Leonardo and Michelangelo developed proportion, perspective, 3 dimensional art and motion in their paintings.  Not so!  These early artists from so many millenia ago were sophisticated in their style and painting techniques.  Our excellent tour guide (we had a tour in English) really knew her stuff and pointed out things we would not have noticed.  It was an awesome learning experience that exceeded our expectations.  The whole Dordogne region is a spectacular part of France and well worth visiting.Read more

Comment: I was so looking forward to seeing what I thought was a long series of caves.  Probably should have done more research before making the trip to see the caves.  There was an English guide, which was good, and our timing was fortunate as they were just getting started.  You are led around by a tour guide and cannot explore by yourself.  Nearly 20 minutes was spent in the opening chamber talking about 2 boys and their dog chasing a rabbit.  Yes, how the caves were found was interesting - but 20 minutes?  When we finally, after a 30 minute boring monologue from the tour guide, got to the caves in question we were rushed along because the next party were entering the caves and we had hardly any time to appreciate the drawings.  Dull, dim lighting, which was not necessary as the paintings we are viewing are replicas, which I did know.  So why not show them in more glory?  No pictures allowed in the caves as, according to the tour guide, the artist who painted the replicas was still alive.   Pharr!  More likely that they want you to buy the postcards at the end of the tour in the souvenir shop!  Overall, far too long with the monologue tour guide and too short in the caves (and there are only 2 caves to see).  Very disappointed and you may want to wait until Lascaux IV opens next year for a better view of this artwork.Read more

Comment: Lascaux II offers the almost exact duplicate of about 90-percent of the original 19,000 year-old prehistory painting in Lascaux. The caves are dark, but the paintings are either highlighted or pointed by a flash light by the tour guide.  Most of them are vivid and beautiful. Visitors are taken into the cave one group at a time with about 30 people. It seems they also take different language groups. We arrived at about 12:30pm and was told that the English tour would be at 2pm. After purchasing the tickets, we still had enough time to go down the mountain to town for a quick lunch. I am not sure how many English tour they have everyday, and imagine that if we had arrived a little later, we might not have been able to be included in the 2pm tour since our session were mostly people from an organized tour group.  Perhaps a little research in advance would be advised for a trip not totally depended on luck - especially if you have to drive far to get here.  Also, make sure you bring a jacket along since the temperature is about 13C or 55F in the cave. The only negative thing about the tours is that there are so many people in each group. Within the not-so-big and dark cave, one can hardly move. Read more

Comment: We booked online so were able to go straight to the waiting area when called. The first part of the tour explains about the geology of the area and how the original was discovered, along with information as to the damage caused by visitors. I was also interested in the explanation as to how the replica was constructed.The next part of the tour explains about how the paintings were recreated using colours as similar in nature to the originals, and also gives a little insight into the life of the people who created the paintings.Finally you are given a tour of the two sections of the replica cave, along with an informative explanation. It would be so easy to miss some of the animals if they weren't pointed out to us!Overall, it was a really informative experience, but I felt that the group size was too big to really appreciate what we were seeing. On the way out we saw the new Lascaux IV, which looks great but I hope doesn't become some sort of Disneyland.Read more

Comment: I thought well, this is old, this is not real caves, am I going to have a meaningful experience? This was a AMAZING experience. And your days are numbered with the new Lascaux IV scheduled to open in the next few months, after that (from what I understand) the "hill" will be closed to the general public. The caves are fragile and ideally the land is returned to Mother Nature. I do think the new LasCaux will be terriic, but there was something so special about being one of the last groups to see LasCaux II. The history of the  discovery of the original caves and the construction of LasCaux II is so interesting. This is a MUST visit site.Read more

Comment: There's a very modern looking new visitor centre being built between the caves and the town of Montignac which is due to open this year so I suspect most of this review will be very out of date soon. However - important points! First, you have to buy your tickets in the tourism office in Montignac before you go. This was annoying as we didn't realise until we'd been through the town and were on our way up the hill. However, it did mean we spent an hour or to in the village which had a couple of interesting brocantes, a fab second hand clothes shop and a really interesting craft fair / expo in a C14th church - all on or just off the Main Street just south of the river - It's a much less touristy and expensive place than we'd been used to elsewhere and we were sorry not to spend longer here!Second, we got a joint ticket with the nearby Thot cro-magnon / prehistoric theme park just down the road. We did them on different days but it saved a bit of money!Third- the English tour of the caves is at 3 in the afternoon - not sure about the morning sorry!Fourth -  I suspect, given the new visitor centre, that there is little investment at the moment in the infrastructure so the facilities are limited - no sinks in the toilets we used and there only seemed to be vending machines to provide drinks.Fifth - the car parks are in the side of the hill and the drop off the road is a bit steep - be careful, pay attention and don't ground the car turning off the road like I did!!Other than that it's an amazing place both because of what it is and what it isn't!!! The biggest cave painting in the world but it's a replica in a replica cave - an amazing thing and an amazing engineering solution! Our kids (and us!) were enthralled by it and it was a real highlight of our holiday.Read more

Comment: Visiting Lascaux II is a unique and moving experience - starting from story of how the cave was discovered, then closed to the public, and then faithfully recreated. Once inside, the guide does an excellent job of pointing out all details with a flashlight. The visits takes roughly 45 min and our tour guide was fluent in English. His tour was accessible and fascinating for kids and grownups alike. Read more

Comment: If you book tickets ahead of time, the experience is smooth and easy. The experience itself is enchanting and the paintings are breath-taking. The guide was very knowledgeable and friendly, spoke good English and our young children were enchanted by the experience. Groups are large, but that didn't take away from the experience for us. Strollers are not permitted inside the cave so be prepared to leave them at the visit entrance and carry your little one. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area interested in prehistory or archeology.Read more

Comment: Having spent nearly 6 months working in the area I visited Lascaux a number of times and was perpetually amazed by the experience. When combined with a Le Thot ticket it makes a wonderful day out for all ages, given there is culture for the old and animals for the young. Learnt a little more each time I visited and gives the feeling it could continually deliver on hidden wonders.Read more

Comment: Although clearly not the original this is a visit which pays great attention to creating a feeling of Lascaux 1. As such it is an enjoyable and informative insight into what 4 young boys stumbled across many years ago. The young guide spoke excellent English giving relevant points, adding a touch of humour to engage the viewers. The tour lasted about 40 minutes and is given in a chosen target language so make sure you choose the correct tour. There is parking on the shaded hillside although this is somewhat erratic. As only a number of visitors enter the exhibit at a time one can usually find a parking space. It is possible to visit Le Thot on a joint ticket. This is an area where the nearest modern animals to those found in the era of Cro-Magno man can be seen. There are workshops and a digital talk showing a few animals but the whole visit is more suited to children. We had an enjoyable experience on the whole.Read more

Comment: This was my second visit to this site - my first being 26 years ago on a school trip !  My Husband and kids had never been.You need to buy the tickets in the Tourist Office in the nearby village of Montignac before you go to the Caves.  You are allocated a time for the visit according to your own language.  We bought a combined ticket with Le Thot but if I were to do it again I would just do the Caves.Although this cave is a replica and you know that before you go in - it is still amazing !  The attention to detail and the work that went into the replication is incredible.Our kids were 10 & 7 and were awed by the experience.  So so glad I returned and brought my family.  Highly recommend.Read more

Comment: We thought this may not live up to the original. But what do we know! Never having visited the original we could quite easily imagine that we were in the real thing, albeit with a floor which was flat (unlike the real one) and easing walking. But the re-creations are truly something else! After a bit of a wait for our timed ticket to come into the correct slot, we were led into the darkness where we had a very good English-speaking guide explain all, stopping at different points with more information, then into the cave proper. What a place!Read more

Comment: Be aware you have to buy tickets ahead of time in Montignac at the Tourism office in the center of town. You'll have a set time for your tour.One of the first things you learn about in any general art history class is the cave paintings of Lascaux. I've known about these paintings for about twenty years, and while this was a recreation, it was still very breathtaking. Personally, I found it more powerful than the paintings in the Louvre (bold statement). But to think that prehistoric people painted this in, basically, pitch darkness and to ponder what it meant to them—magical experience. It's a quick tour. Our kids were even fine through it. Definitely a must see. The drive there from the southern approach was probably one of the most beautiful drives I've ever taken. Every turn was another postcard moment.Read more

Comment: We spent a week in the Dordogne and I was keen to see some of the famous prehistoric cave paintings. Lascaux II was pretty well known and mentioned in the guide book but when I read what it said, it made me think twice about whether I still wanted to visit. Lascaux II is a man-made cave where the original cave paintings have simply been copied.......BUT DON'T LET THIS PUT YOU OFF!! The original Lascaux caves were found half way though the last century and then eventually opened up to tourists. But in the 1960's the caves had to be closed as the bacteria from the visiting tourists was destroying the original cave paintings. So, some very clever people decided to create an EXACT copy of the cave and paint EXACT copies of the cave paintings 200 metres from the original site. What they have created is extraordinary. The cave is exactly the same size as the original and tours visit the caves every 30-40 minutes. Each tour can cater for up to 40 people but that's squeezing everyone in quite tight. The paintings are fantastic and are accurate to within a couple of millimetres of the originals and they were painted using natural materials. I was really amazed by how big the paintings were and how many of them there were. They are so bright an colourful. The guide will talk you through the discovery of the caves and the specific paintings. We managed to get a place on the last tour of the day which was conducted in French but I wouldn't be surprised if some tours are conducted in English.On your way to the carpark there's a big sign by the side of the road saying that you can only get in to the caves if you've bought a ticket in the town (1.5 miles away). Don't worry about that - you can still go to the ticket office and buy tickets and the cost is Euros 11 per person. Don't be put off by thinking that you;re not seeing the originals - these copies, in the semi-darkness of the cave will amaze you.Read more

Comment: For those that don't know, Lascaux II is a 100% replica of the real cave, made due to the destruction of the original by too many human visitors. As such it is not real which is a genuine shame but totally understandable so if you are expecting a cold cave with bats and dripping walls it's not going to happen. We knew that before we went but it has to be said that it is a fascinating place to visit to understand what went on over 17000 years ago.The original cave network spanned some 230m whereas L2 is only 80m long showing the same number of paintings shoehorned in.The tour is quite short but excellently communicated by the English speaking tour guides who explain the history really well.L4 is due to open at the end of 2016 and is a true replica cave system.....the full 230m and an exact copy. You can't miss it being built on the way up to L2. This I am sure will be a superb experience and give a real flavour of what 4 lads and a dog called robot accidentally discovered in 1940 (See.....I was  paying attention...😀).Ps.....Lascaux III already exists and is a travelling exhibition which goes a round the works showing off this piece of important history.Read more

Comment: A review of this site on Lonely Planet stated that although the reproductions were beautifully done using original techniques and are better than nothing, but invariably, they can't match the thrill of seeing original paintings. I can't disagree more. I for one, was more than thrilled with the reproductions. I am grateful that the French spent 11 years to meticulously reproduce more than 90% of the 600 plus glorious animal figures so that I could stand in total awe of the beauty and magnificence of the genius of these prehistorical painters (150,00 to 170,000 years ago) in the knowledge that the originals are safely sealed and protected for the ages. If I thought that the tour was too short, I would be perfectly willing to go back for a second round. Personally, I regard the experience of seeing these cave paintings better than any single exhibition in Louvre or d'Orsay and that would include Mona Lisa or Monet's lilies (they are so ubiquitous as to cease thrilling). Picasso allegedly muttered "We have invented nothing" after a visit. Indeed!!Please note that from April to September, ticket to the cave must be bought at the Office of Tourism in Montignac, about 2 km northwest. Montignac itself is a delightful little medevil town. Well worth spending some time strolling through.Read more

Comment: I visited four rock art sites in Southern France this month, and Lascaux II was the most disappointing.  The guide there crammed 37 people into a couple of small rooms that should not hold more than 10 or 12 people at once.  Squeezed in like sardines, shoulder to shoulder, wall to wall, our view of the 'walls' and displays was often obscured.  I asked if they usually put that many people in the tour, and she said that they regularly had up to 40!  The room was a warm and stuffy, and the paintings were rendered on what appeared to be fiberglass impressions of the surface of the caves, intermittently suspended from the ceiling.  It didn't look or feel anything like a cave.  I understand the need to protect the original paintings, but with all the work that went into recreating the paintings, it's such a shame to spoil the effect by overcrowding, poor setup and poor management.  The Lascaux paintings themselves are amazing, so go if it's a check mark on your bucket list.  But if you have children, take them to see Peche Merle or Grotte de Rouffignac instead.  You can't beat the experience of venturing into a cool, damp fairyland of stalagmites and stalactites and the feeling that you're actually standing where Cro-Magnon man once stood with nothing more than a torch to light his way.Read more

Comment: We had already visited several real caves in the Dordogne and they were incredible to see. Lascaux II was built to resemble the real Lascaux which is closed to the public. The recreated paintings were done by one woman. The tour explains in detail how this cave was made and details of each painting. Considering the time it takes to get there and difficulty in securing a ticket. We recommend seeing the real deal caves in the region for a thrilling  awe inspiring experience.

However, the lighting is too bright, the texture of the walls  looks like fiberglass, the walkway is wide and smooth. Doesn't feel Ike a real cave, doesn't smell like a real cave.

Comment: It seems a little strange to rank this experience as only average as the fabulous reproduction of pre-historic paintings is a must see. They are amazing. There is little point adding to what is already widely reported on Tripadvisor but the truth is that the sooner the new visitor centre is open the better. The 40 minute experience is a "sheep dip" where you enjoy the reproduction and the limited explanations but come away feeling short changed for €12.50. Our guide had a poor English accent which did not help and the "journey" is too short and not informative. It needs a fuller interactive experience with a full explanation of the story, told through the medium of cinema/theatre. It should be at least a full morning and the visitor should go away with learning as well as an experience. If you came to the Dordogne for this only, you would be disappointed. Let's hope that the new visitor centre is a transformation. Read more

Comment: We waited for our tour in English, but it was disappointing.  The reproductions may have been great, but we were packed in tighter than economy class on an airplane.  We were so jammed together that I could see only the high paintings.  The guide spoke fair English, but there was no way to get the "feel" of the cave while staring at the back of the man in front of me (or dodging the hacking cough of the one behind me).  I had expected this to be the highlight of my trip, but found it to be a let down, instead.  Based on this experience, I would not recommend it.   Luckily, there are other caves in the area which give a much better experience.Read more

Comment: The breakfast hour’s line of storms had moved off to the east and the sky was pretty much blue. Nonetheless, we’d decided this was our cave-visit day, and headed off to see Lascaux II, advertised as a meticulous reproduction of the original (now closed to the public because of damage inflicted by the emanations of the first million visitors). Because it was April, we imagined the site would not be crowded. Silly us! We’d managed to go during France’s spring break, which meant contending with mobs of parents and their children. (Apparently spring break in France does not mean kids can play; it means that instead of teachers teaching them, it’s their parents’ turn.) The upshot was that to buy tickets took longer than to visit the actual site. But wait! Having a ticket does not mean you can just go down into the cave. No, you have bought a guided visit at a designated time. For us, this meant having a couple of hours to kill in Montignac. That wasn’t so bad; the town on the Vezère is old and pretty. Still, it was not our choice of where to spend precious time. Well, over a barrel, we did, and finally the moment came for our tour. It turned out to be just 40 minutes long, of which the first 20 were for “orientation,” leaving only 20 to crowd inside the room with reproduced drawings. Yes, they were impressive, but on the whole, the experience was not enjoyable. For example, I much preferred the experience of watching Werner Herzog’s Cave of Forgotten Dreams in 3D, for which I did not have to travel to France, and did not have to spend an hour in line for a ticket, followed by a 2-hour meander in a place I hadn’t wanted to see. If you are near Lascaux and want to visit a cave, try the Grotto of Rouffignac instead. It's not in color, but it's real, you'll see many drawings and the logistics are much better.Read more

Two of us speak French so we were able to interpret the highlights to our family, but I would say you need a good level of French as a lot of the vocabulary is more specialist. My 8 year old son didn't understand a word, and isn't particularly interested in this sort if thing,  but he found plenty of interest to look at and the 40 minute tour flew by. The paintings are amazing and are interesting food for thought. Read more

Comment: We've done three original caves (two of which I had booked tickets two months earlier, see my reviews of Combarelles and Font de Gaume). It was our last day of holiday, a Friday. I was the only one still motivated for Lascaux II. So we thought we'd not stress, have a late morning start, try our luck and do something else if no tickets were left. I've read everywhere that you need to buy tickets in the nearby town of Montignac. Yes there is still some roadworks, but last sunny Friday at 1030am there were no traffic jams. No lines at the ticket office, well, only two other families before me. The next French speaking tour was in half an hour (English speaking tours available too). The lady said earlier in the week there were long queues, but today, it was "correct". Since the French usually do holiday rents from Saturdays to Saturdays (it's known that these days are red if not black days on the national highways), it's probable that most people do the top of their list itinerary earlier in the week. We arrived in Lascaux. Parking available, albeit a bit disorganized and rustic for a big site like this. Toilets and boutique and picnic tables and even a snack bar further away (sorry I'm not sure if it's open), really, I think they could have made more effort to have the ticket office here too, but well. There is shade and lots of space, fair amount of people too, the guides were calling out groups and we realized there were groups every 20 minutes entering the cave. 40 people in each group, really ten too many, we had done the original caves with groups of 7 and 25 for conservation purposes, 40 felt crowded. Signs saying if your children were noisy they would be asked to leave, and it's true with these kind of crowds it's hard to hear the guide even with her microphone if there is too much noise. Still, ours didn't ask the parents of the young whining guzzling baby to leave. Probably doable if you have sleeping slung babies, but you have all my sympathy if your happy toddler starts tantrum-ing inside. Mine were now six eight and twelve, the guides are really nice and do make sure the children are placed in front for a better view, and move around to make sure everyone could see, but they have a tough job when there are so many people each time. Having said all the above, the caves are very impressive, 40 minutes flew by, especially after having done original caves and understanding the difficulties these cave artists face to do their art. The copy has a real cave feel, kudos to the artists and designers who spent ten years on it, and great idea to build it underground, it had better atmosphere than Chauvet which we have visited too earlier. You must see it in 3D in the cave sense, photos don't do them justice, and I think I will visit Lascaux IV too when it is ready, to see the other galleries, as this one presents only the two biggest halls in Lascaux. There is a comic book by Biggotto and Thierry someone about the kids' discoveries of the cave, find it on Amazon, it's worth it too. You can see the entrance to the original cave 200m in the forest nearby, ask the guide or at the boutique, it's not signposted, and it's locked with a gate and you catch only glimpses of the entry point. But it's still amazing to think Cro-Magnons and possibly Neanderthals walked this very forest so many thousand years ago. History is awesome.Read more

Comment: That our ancient Cro-Magnon ancestors painted such beautiful and realistic paintings is fascinating enough. The story of how we found the caves in modern times is also fascinating. And right up there on the fascination scale is how the demand to see these paintings and these caves and the opposing demand to protect them from the damage of breath and light and accidents were both met by painstakingly recreating the caves down the hill in another cave. The story of how it was done, how carefully it was replicated is nothing short of amazing.  As others mentioned, you don't get to spend a lot of time - and that's because so many of your fellow homo sapiens are also fascinated.  But - this is important - all of the caves and exhibits and sites around the Dordogne are available in English, you just have to find out what time - it's usually only one per day. We were guided on this tour by a charming and ennthusiastic man who spoke excellent English.Read more

Comment: The reproduced paintings in the caves are undeniably beautiful! We were part of an English tour, which was delivered slightly flippantly and over in 30 mins. The actual area one walks through is rather small and just a short section of the whole cave system that is permanently closed to the public. There is a small book/artefacts shop at the caves. There is nowhere to buy anything to eat or drink and there is a wait between each tour group, so be prepared. Lascaux 4 is underway and promises to re-produce the entire cave system in 2916. I look forward to that.Read more

Comment: We visited once the ticketing had moved onsite, so went straight there in time for a tour before the lunchtime closure. We bought our ticket at 11, with the next English tour at 12.10. Not a problem, we thought, we'll have a coffee... Except there are no refreshment options on site at all! (Vending machine selling bottled water doesn't really work as a time-killing option). We walked the 800m (in the rain) to the signposted cafe/restaurant to find it closed (seemingly permanently). Maybe the operators of Lascaux could take the signage down...So - if you're visiting out of season (when you have to go straight there), maybe take a picnic!It's odd that you can't book online in advance - that would remove a lot of the problems cited by many reviewers.This aside, the visit itself was well worth it. Our guide's English was very good, and her knowledge of, and passion for the subject matter was very clear to see. She highlighted all the main features in the caves very well, and really brought the past to life. It's such a well known historic site that it's really worth the trip. The new site being built down the hill (Lascaux VI) looks like it will be very impressive, but will surely lack the intimacy and experience (being only metres from the original) of the current attraction.... I'm pretty sure it will have a cafe though!Read more

Comment: According to the books, there is only one genuine cave-painting experience in the area but they only allow in a modest number per day - and you need to be early in peak season. We're not that obsessive or organised on holiday so we opted for Lascaux II as an almost-genuine experience (with that added nice feeling inside that you're not damaging the genuine caves with your steamy breath).It might be reproduction but it was obviously done with a lot of care, and once you are inside it genuinely feels like you are in a real cave. Try to get there early if you want to be sure to get a tour in your own language(s) as that's definitely worthwhile. I wouldn't have had such a fine experience if I hadn't understood everything the guide was saying. And the guide, and older English lady, was really knowledgeable. Be prepared to wait a while after getting your tickets so plan lunch or something in the town in between buying tickets and taking the tour. And (unlike us) be sure to get there early enough before most places stop selling food at 3pm.Read more

Comment: Don't let the fact that what you see is a recreation deter you from this amazing experience as the recreation is down to the last bump in the rocks and pretty amazing in itself.  Those prehistoric artists were so talented, incorporating rock formations into their paintings and a series of animals to show movement.Read more

Comment: Lascaux II allows you an instant time travel experience. Entering the cave (even if it is a perfect replica), really makes you wonder and admire those ancient men. and the way they would express themselves. Already more than 15k years ago, the human ingenuity and artist expression was impressive. Lascaux was in my bucket list for several years, and, in my opinion, it should be in everyone's list. It is one of those places where you will get the WoW effect, as the guide tells all the cave and painting secrets.Tickets can be bough onsite, but only after the second week of September. Check their website, since there are some peak periods where tickets must be purchased in Montignac. Also, you have the option for French and English tours (not sure about other languages). Do take note that you only enter with a tour guide, and it takes around 40 minutes.Read more

Comment: Imagine finding an "art gallery" with art that dates back between 15,000 and 18,000 years BC! Imagine finding an "art gallery" with amazing animal images all over the walls and ceiling!Now imagine all of this painted onto rock in an underground cave using black, ochre yellow and red mineral paint and you have Lascaux II.Even though this is a replica cave, you can imagine that you are in the real thing and immediately appreciate the beauty of the often detailed paintings of horses, reindeer and large bulls.If are visiting the Dordogne region, do make a point of heading to Montignac and the Lascaux II cave reproduction to experience the extraordinary artistry in the Dordogne!P.S. We visited on 13/09 and purchased our tickets on site without delay.Read more

Comment: Considering the caves of Lascaux that can be visited are accurate recreations of the original, the effect is very impressive.  That it has been recreated in a different set of caves helps, as it is dark and cold inside.Along with this comes a fascinating story of the cave system, discovery, and recreation for conservation purposes.  Our guide clearly had a real passion for the work.Read more

Comment: I did not want to go. I did not want to go because it is a  facsimile (not original) and I was not paricularly interested in prehistoric paintings/caves. I just wented because the rest of the familly wanted to go. However I was completely overwhelmed by the experience. Michelin guid is right: "Vaut le voyage".Pay attention. From April to September they do NOT sell tickets on site. You can buy tickets at a small booth, at Montignac, behind the tourist office. The tours are guided tours, so on peak times you might want to book in advance.Read more

Comment: Definitely worth visiting, they do Tours in English and German.  Guides are very interesting and bring the history to life.  Not good for families with very small children as you are in confined space in the dark and any noise apart from the guides narration spoils the visit for everyone.Read more

Comment: We ordered our tickets beforehand from our hotel concierge.  You must specify English tour.  It was a breeze picking up our actual tickets onsite.  The visit is rather short, but for most people you certainly receive enough information to enjoy the experience.  We really appreciated the guide asking two women with screaming babies to leave, as no one could hear his comments with those infants in tow.Read more

Comment: My comment refers to the organisation around the attraction, not the cave paintings themselves.  Five stars for the actual paintings and the detail in the reproduction, well worth seeing.However, the paintings are diminished by the organisation surrounding the experience. Fine to buy tickets in another location during the peak periods, but knowing it is peak time and a very popular tourist attraction, it is mind boggling that there is one ticket window selling tickets!!??  The queue of people in the sun buying tickets for 40 min can be halved at least by just having a second ticket window or electronic ticket machines.  When picking up the tickets, there was not an explanation about how to get to Lascaux II and we needed to ask.  It would be useful to have this information on one of the boards in the queue area instead of some random chateau of the region.The parking is non existent which other reviewers have talked about so don't need to labour this point. Suffice to say, get a park as soon as you can in the main street of Montignac and walk up to the tourist office.  The parking at Lascaux II is ad hoc in so much as it is in a number of different places without signage or parking space lines. In France in my experience this means that there are huge spaces in between cars and odd angles of cars and camper vans which runs the risk of being parked in. Once inside the supposed advertised 40min tour our guide appeared disinterested and going through the motions. They were clipped and terse in response to questions of the group and the tour was all over and we were back outside within 20min of arriving into the first introduction room! So much for 40 min.. or the ability to review the paintings or exhibit windows on display independently of the guides torch which was very disappointing. I admit the young children who were in our tour were noisy and distracting to our group visit so perhaps the guide was well over it by then and wanted to be finished early? None the less the guide was by far the most unfriendly guide we have had in France, and at a major tourist attraction, this too was mind boggling. I greatly support the efforts of conservation for the caves and think the reproduction was excellent which is why it was disappointing to have the organisation around the experience so amateur.  With any luck, the currently being built Lascaux III might address some of these basics. Read more

Comment: I bought tickets at the booth located in the center of Montignac near the tourist information. All tours are guided and I select English tour starting 11:50. The cave locates a couple of kms from the center. The tour started at 12:00. Lascaux II is not the original but, for me, it, cave and pictures, is very realistic. The guide said it took more than a decade to reproduce complete copy. I do not qualified to comment, because I haven't been original cave. But, still it is exciting to see those pictures in the dark cave. Quite an experience.  The tour took 40minutes at only three stops. The explanation of a guide might be a bit too.Read more

Comment: Armed with a Brochure we are off early to see the cave paintings , BUT the brochure is not very explicit ....with only GPS co-ordinates for the caves, no addresses & no mention about buying all "entrance tickets in Montignac" ..... it's Sunday so, of course, the Tourist centre is closed, & therefore information or directions can't be accessed. By 9:30 we give up & go to the Cliff Castles & other local attractions. They give us a heads up about Lascaux & ticket sales. We head back to Montignac to buy the tickets & get directions to the Caves We arrive, & even though next in the queue, we wait ages while a French couple try & decide if they should spend the extra E3 & do both Caves. The ticket seller was very patient, laughing & joking in French, while they decided. We finally get served, only to find we have now missed the English Tour, but told we can do the French tour in 40mins (as we obviously can't speak French the answer would be NO!). Disappointed, We explain the problems we had earlier & the Young, Arrogant, French Self-Absorbed Female told us "maybe we should have googled it & been more prepared" & didn't seem to care that the Brochures are misleading ..... She made us feel stupid for relying on the Brochures, when there is "Google". We were then told to "leave" as she had customers waiting ......however, she didn't mind keeping us waiting till we missed the tour ...... we do leave, but are not very happy. We decide to forget about the Lascaux Caves .... especially as the ones on show are only reproductions & we decide to drive about 30minutes away to see the Sorcerer's Grotto Cave Paintings. We luck it this time .... a tour is about to start, with the Lovely Lola as our Guide.... 8 on the tour .... in French & English (English - just for us). What we saw was Authentic; Neolithic; & up close & personal.....which, in the long run, was much better. We recommend: Don't waste your time at the Lascaux II- go straight to the Sorcerer's Grotto.....much better experience all round.Read more

Comment: I visited Lascaux II on the 13th of July with my wife and two children (both 7 years old) and found the experience completely enthralling. We were blessed with a truly exceptional tour guide who captivated us with the story of the original discovery at Lascaux, it's subsequent development and the urgent need to protect it leading to the construction of Lascaux II. It was his description of the paintings however that had us captivated, he really brought them and the artists to life. Thank you so much, Guin. (I hope I have spelt your name correctly). One tip, you need to purchase your tickets in beautiful, nearby Montignac so get there early. We queued for 40 minutes in blistering heat, that said, it was worth it. (You can pre-book too)Read more

Comment: As other reviewers have pointed out you have to purchase tickets in the nearby town of Montignac at certain times of the year.  Whilst some feel this is ridiculous,  I think if I was a Montignac business owner I would be very grateful about this decision.  It would be very easy to miss this pretty village if you could buy the tickets at the caves.  As for my comment about babies and young children, going inside the caves it is very dark which unsettled the two very young ones in the group we were in.  Queue crying which made it difficult to hear the excellent tour guide.  It appears that once in you can't get out until the tour finishes which made it unpleasant for the children, their parents and the rest of the tour group.  As I say our tour guide was excellent.  Our teenager couldn't get past the fact that these were fake but then he is more to the thrills and adventure.  So maybe best to leave the teenagers behind too unless there are into history!  Worth the money and well signpostedRead more

Comment: The fact that Lascaux II is a reconstruction (some would say a fake) does not in any way detract from the overall experience. The cave has been recreated as a millimetre precise copy of the real thing a few hundred metres away. The guide was very informative, competent, witty and kept it short. An American tourist ahead of me complained that the passageway through the chambers was all too narrow: why hadn't it been made wider to accommodate those of a wider girth. Seriously.The only downside is that you can only buy admission tickets from the official sales point (the tourist office) in the town of Montignac, several kliks away. Only the French would insist on this. Parking is very limited in Montignac and the sales point is smack in the centre. It took us 20 minutes to find a parking space, 45 minutes to queue and finally managed to get a ticket for the next available visiting time 2 hours later. Normally I wouldn't have bothered, but fortunately Montignac is a charming town and we found time to eat lunch first followed by a 45 minute walk, based on a route provided by the tourist office pamphlet.Read more

Comment: When you take 6 years of hard work to create a replica, and you use exactly the same techniques and materials as the original artist, I believe you have proven, beyond any doubt, that you care about visitors' experience, and if there was any way to do it without ruining it, the original cave would be made available. Sign up for an English speaking group if at all possible, the narration is really very  informative!BTW, when they say no tickets are available onsite, they really mean it, save yourself a major inconvenience, and buy them beforehand at the tourist info in a town nearby, which is also a good place for lunch!Read more

Comment: When I heard it was a replica, I had my doubts. However, they were completely unfounded. What an amazing experience and as you can't visit the original anymore because of damaging it (by the carbon monoxide we breathe out), an opportunity not to be missed. The drawings were incredible, the 3D nature of them and the movement within them - awesome! It is a very unassuming location in the Forrest but worked really well. Plenty of parking and a waiting area undercover. Fortunately we realised you had to buy tickets in Montignac (head for the tourist information) but the queue was very small and it wasn't a problem. We will return to Lascaux 4 which opens next year and have a replica of not just the one tunnel and drawings but the other tunnels with carvings and more drawings. Read more

Comment: This is a must see experience even if the powers that be are conspiring to make it very difficult to do so. You cannot buy tickets online. You cannot buy tickets on site. Instead, you must buy tickets at the Tourism office in Montignac. Good luck finding it!  Beware: lots of roadwork and one way streets and not lots of signage. Tip: give yourself plenty of extra time to find. This is not an attraction that you can buy the tickets and go in. Instead, you will purchase for a later time slot so need to be flexible. All that said, this is very good and a profound insight into early humanity. Amazing really. A recreation, yes, but meticulously done. Great educational experience. Read more

Comment: Of course it's a reproduction, but the real thing was closed in 1963 so it wouldn't succumb to miss and calcification. Accept that fact and enjoy the copy! Our [English-speaking] guide was very good and obviously excited about the art work, and helped us all appreciate details one might otherwise miss in the dim lighting. We found the site well worth the visit.It's also worth repeating that you must buy your tickets in nearby Montignac from April through September, so don't wind your way up without your proper billets! And speaking of winding, follow the road signs and not your GPS. I'm not sure where we went the first time with the GPS, but we had to backtrack.Seeing the paintings soothed that irritation quickly.Read more

Comment: And what a funny experience it proved to be!  Let me begin by saying that when I was a beginning reader one of the first stories I ever read was about Lascaux & back there in 1958 I resolved to visit there one day & see it for myself.Well, I did!  But it's such a strange experience.  Our GPS took us in circles & we managed to find Lascaux II (passing all the while signs that urged visitors to buy tix in the local town...& we unwisely paid those signs no heed) & when we got to the glorious site with a huge ticket booth --- the only thing you can do at the ticket booth is pick up tickets you've already reserved.  Right!  Back into the local town at 12:15 to find that the ticket office is closed until 2PM which tragedy we lightened by a delicious lunch with a nice wine.  Got tickets for the English speaking tour at 4PM but NOT SO FAST as they had more French speaking people who needed to get in first (huh?) & so the English speaking tour previously known as the 4PM tour now departed at about 4:30. The guide told us that someone in the previous group "became ill" & they needed to clean up (this while we were in the first chamber) & so we were further delayed.The caves are a fascinating reproduction of the original & you get a true feeling for what the original must be.  The original caves, btw, are explored once a week by staff to make sure that they are still all they should be etc.  At the end of the tour there is a large sign urging you to tip the guide if you enjoyed your experience.  I am a museum guide in the USA & cannot imagine anything like that getting anywhere near the museum in which I work.  Clearly the level of visitation could sustain wages for the guides & this begging at the end should be eliminated!Read more

Comment: We visited Grotte de Rouffignac cave the day before we visited Lascaux II because we wanted to compare "real" cave art to replicated cave art.  I know each cave offers vastly different types of art but we were not impressed at all with Rouffignac.  (Much of this was because they only offer tours in French).  Lascaux II turned out to be one of our favorite stops on our trip through France.  Even though this is a replica of Lascaux, it is done so well you would never know.  They offer English tours (very highly recommended if you don't speak French) and we learned an enormous amount on our tour.  The sheer volume of cave art is incredible.  We went away with a greater appreciation for the people who created these drawings and realized they weren't primitive at all.  I highly recommend this tour - it isn't cheesy as I feared and the whole family will enjoy the experience.Read more

Comment: Please don't be put off by the fact that these 'caves' are a replica: they are reproduced to within a few millimetres of the original and are generally very atmospheric. In my experience the English speaking guides are wonderfully knowledgeable and bring the caves and their story to life. Because I have a holiday home in the area I've visited many times with our visitors and I'm frankly always enchanted. It's very a uncommercialised experience and once you've bought your tickets (see other reviews) the site offers plentiful parking.I've bothered to write this review because I recently visited the new replica of the Chauvet Caves where the drawings are thousands of years older and much simpler in form. In contrast to Lascaux, Chauvet is a huge example of form over substance - amazingly imagined cafe, shop, walks but the paintings themselves are displayed in what could be an aircraft hanger. The visitor experience to the actual replica paintings seems to have been completely overlooked and is horrid. PLEASE Lascaux take note of their mistakes before you finish your project at Lascaux 4.Read more

Comment: I have always been a bit put off by the idea that the caves at Lascaux 2 are a copy of the (now closed) original, however we were in the area for a weekend and I decided to give them a try and I was not disappointed. The caves are small (but then so are the originals!) but the paintings quite incredible. Our guide (we did the French language tour, but there are tours in English too) was very informative and really brought the whole experience to life, he took particular care of the youngsters in the group and kept them spellbound. It takes about 40 minutes for the tour and there isn't much else to do at he site, but it is definitely worth a trip.Read more

Comment: firstly, check the Lascaux 11 website, in some months the tickets can be purchased at the site, but it seems that during the busy season, they are only available at the kiosk behind the tourist centre at Montignac. Perhaps, since you are allocated a tour time when you buy the tickets, this regulates the number of people and vehicles at the site at any one time. There was a queue to get tickets - we were allocated to 2.40pm, so we found a local restaurant to have lunch and enjoy a bit of people watching before heading the 2.5 kms. Out to the caves.There is adequate parking for cars and camper cars.Toilets and picnic tables as well as coin operated drink machines are located at the far end of the carpark. There is also a smallish gift shops which mostly sells guide books and children's books, mostly in French but there are a couple in other languages if you are interested.You must be on a tour to visit the caves - the 40 minute tours were conducted in French and English at about 10 minute intervals on the day we visited - English and French were alternated as there was enough demand. We had a very knowledgable young man as our guide with a great command of English and a delightful accent. I don't think you would be able to fully appreciate the painting without a guide to point out all the features and their methods of application.Yes, they are a replica of the original, but don't get caught up in that, appreciate the magnificence of the work for the time it was created - 17,000 years ago!! Photos really don't do justice to the reality when you are in the caves - they are awesome.Definitely worth the visit!Read more

Comment: The cave paintings of Lascaux are world-famous but their beauty and fame was leading to their destruction.  Visitors brought in their interest but also their sweat, breath and various fungi that attacked the precious paintings.  Fortunately, the Ministry in charge realized early enough to close the cave to visits to save the prehistoric originals but had the foresight to construct an accurate replica nearby for the cultural tourists.  It is easily accessed and very clearly and intelligently explained by the trained guides.  Important to know that you must have a ticket ($12 euros for adults) for access and these are available in Montignac or through the agency of many nearby hotels (our hotel in Sarlat got our tickets for an English tour a month before our arrival).   Tours are timed and that helps so that you know when to arrive.  The replica consists of approximately 4 chambers with dim lighting (for atmosphere) but  proper level floors so no fear of tripping or falling.  The full-scale figures are magnificent and the guides explain all the various issues--how they were painted and with what materials, the subtle incorporation of the rock forms in the shapes of the animals and sophisticated shading and contours defining movement, even the construction of wooden scaffolding and the deer fat lamps used to light the work.  Such achievements 17000 years ago!Finding the site was no problem but the new museum of Prehistoryand replica(Lascaux 3) being constructed nearby make the entry road a bit bumpy at the moment.  All efforts are worth it, however, and the experience is unforgettable--even if you don't like caves!Read more

Comment: very mixed feelings; even though the paintings are modern reproductions, the experience is awesome. However, the procedure to get into the caves can be frustrating, cumbersome and down right infuriating.1. Cannot reserve or buy tickets on line2. Must buy tickets at the tourist center in town3. Although we were buying our tickets at 1:30 pm, the next available English tour was not till 11:30 the following morning. Since we drove almost 2 hours to the museum, we took the French tour4. Limited signage at museum, and all in French.5. Single announcement regarding start of tour ( again, just in French).6.

Comment: we have just been back for 2 hours from this tour and felt I needed to writ this down.  No English tour available. Fine, we thought surely there would be a brochure or at least some explanations in the tour to try to get some idea of what we were seeing. Nothing. We asked the guide, and were given a one word answer...no. As amazing as the art is, being packed in a very small space for 40 minutes for three viewing areas and having no idea what we were seeing was a negative. Better to see it on utube or read a book.

Comment: I'd like to give this 4 stars, but being kept waiting for your tour is hard to swallow when time and space matters so much on a European trip. We arrived early Just before 2pm for an after lunch tour but there was a 20 min wait before the French language tour started and then another 20 minutes for the English tour. Add another 20 because...I don't know why...and it is 3pm before we are underway. This meant we were not able to fit in another site we had planned for the afternoon.  Even so, the efforts of all who developed this recreation of the real McCoy need to be commended. It is a very faithful duplication by all accounts - but it just does not have the same emotional connection as visiting sites which present original Cro Magnon works. Not sure why non flash photos can't be taken...it is a replication in concrete and epoxy...Read more

Comment: Although it is disappointing that the caves the tourists see are replicas , rhe reasons for this are understandable. Wonderful experience.   I have been twice now. If you are at all claustrophobic, this is not for you. The tours I have been on were so packed that it was at times difficult to fully take in all the paintings and commentary.  I went on two French spoken tours and, unless your French is 'formidable', it is difficult to keep up. If going in the heat of summer, take a wrap or light jacket with you as It can be chilly in the caves themselves. Great shop to buy items as reminders of your visit.A very worthwhile and memorable visit.Read more

After reading a few of the previous reviews, I looked at it a little different.ly in that I am happy that the original works have been preserved and understand the need for the identical replica. Good that you can't take pictures because flashing lights of cameras as you walk through the wonders of the caves would ruin the experience.

Comment: We purchased tickets for the 2 p.m., 45 minute, English tour of the caves directly at the site of the caves, not the tour office.  These caves are a reproduction of the original caves which are no longer available for tours due to CO2 damage.  The tour guide described the detailed reproductions very well, however, knowing that they are not the originals took away some of the fascination.  Even though these were reproductions, we were not allowed to take any pictures even without a flash.  I appreciate the fact that the original cave is being protected and preserved, however, I would rather see and experience original drawings that are located in caves elsewhere.Read more

Comment: Don't get me wrong.  The Lascaux paintings are breathtaking.  I can only imagine what it must have been like to stumble into the original cave and find this glorious art.  However, you will not have that experience.  You will instead be crowded into a small space with 40 of your closest friends (they will be when you're done, you're that tightly packed), and listen to a canned pitch from someone who is doing this as a job. The replica experience was ruined from the outset by the little museum at the mouth of the "cave."  In addition, the lighting inside was much too bright to convey anything like the feeling of being inside a real cave.  And leading 40 people through at a time takes away what little opportunity you might have to appreciate the art.  Our guide probably meant well, but he had no passion for the art or the people who made it.  He was going through a spiel that he had clearly given many times before.It was a bit like going to see a replica of the Mona Lisa.  Yes, it's a faithful reproduction, but you can get good photos in a coffee table book also.Save your time and money, and go see some real paleolithic art elsewhere.  This is just not worth it.Lascaux IV is being built, and I'm hopeful that they can avoid some of the worst mistakes by putting the little museum exhibits in a separate building, much like you'd find at Pech Merle.  (Which, by the way, is much more worthwhile if you can get in.)Read more

Comment: The caves were stunning and far exceeded expectations. The experience lost nothing for being in the replica cave.However, we probably wouldn't have gone at all if the tourist office lady had had her way in Montignac - she was the most unhelpful she could have been. We had read that you had to get tickets there from April to September, rather than at the caves and that only a few tours were in English. Seems the ticket bit is only until mid September, so we had to get the tickets at the caves, a mile further on. I asked what time the English tours were, she didn't know - this is only the main attraction in the area. As we were already parked in the town, we decided to have a coffee. Not wanting to miss an English tour, I crossed back over to the tourist office and asked the lady if she could phone the Caves and ask the times - no she couldn't, she didn't have the number (despite all the leaflets)! I said I had the number and would give it to her. Guess what ......... now her phones were mysteriously not working! It's a shame it left a sour taste on what was an otherwise fantastic visit.Read more

Comment: The actual caves at Lascaux are closed to visitors because the exhaled carbon dioxide damages the cave paintings.  Instead, you can visit a precise recreation of the main cave spaces at Lascaux.  Despite being a reproduction, we found it compelling.

Comment: You need to buy your tickets in the tourist office in Montignac. Then drive to the caves. These are replicas of the caves because the actual caves are being preserved. They are in danger of mold and deterioration from visitors so they built a replica nearby. These are still worth a visit. They take about 20-30 people at a time. There is a guided tour and the walls look very lifelike. You still feel like you are seeing the real thing. The guide explains much of what you are seeing. It is cool in the caves so you might want to bring a light sweater or jacket. The tour takes about 30-45 minutes and is well worth the price. These are 17,000 year old paintings during the Cro-Magnon era. Amazing what they were capable of and what they saw and drew. Glad I went. Highly recommend this.Read more

Comment: Once you maneuver through the ticket process (have to purchase tickets in one city, get your assigned time, drive to 2nd nearby city for the tour), the tour is well worth it!  We signed up for the English speaking tour.  Unfortunately, our guide was French and his English was very poor (this had not been the case for the majority of France we've visited).  We certainly understood the main points he shared, but we are sure we missed much of the highlights of his speech.The reproductions of the paintings were wonderful and very interesting.  Initially, we thought it might be "lame" because they were reproductions but not at all.  I would recommend this to anyone, and especially think it would be very educational for older children.Read more

Comment: Amazing et disappointing.  The cave drawings were all anyone could hope for however there was a nagging 'they're not the real thing' feeling plus the fact that we saw a tiny portion, 3 rooms.  Add to that the fact that it was an English speaking tour attended by folks that didn't understand English so their companions would be translating as we went along making it very difficult to hear the guide.  Oh and let's not forget the people that bring their children, that fuss and cry.  Really?  I travel 2500+ miles to see this and can't hear what the guide says...pppfffttt.  The paintings are amazing, the experience much less so.....Read more

Comment: Lascaux II is an extremely accurate recreation of the Lascaux caverns discovered in 1940.  For many years visitors were taken through the original cave to see the amazing polychrome paintings left by our ancestors many thousands of years ago.  However, the paintings began to seriously deteriorate due to the environmental changes caused by the many visitors.  The recreation is reputed to be extremely faithful to the original and the experience very nearly duplicates what one would have in an actual cave.  The paintings are stunning and represent a level of sophistication that is difficult to comprehend considering when they were made.  There are other caves in the area accessible to the public, some more limited than others, where the actual drawings and etchings are still to be seen.  It is a moving experience not to be missed.Read more

Comment: No photo of this cave art does it justice. You need to visit these caves to appreciate the feelings of movement, immediacy and purpose. You will forget this cave is a replica as soon as you set foot in the hall of bulls. I only wish we could have stayed longer. Our guide spoke excellent English and really added value to our experience. I loved hearing about how the cave was discovered, and why it was closed. She highlighted aspects of the cave paintings that I might have missed and gave several possible interpretations. Getting tickets is a bit difficult, so do your research (Lonely Planet website helped us out). When we visited (June 2014) you had to buy tickets from the office in Montignac (next to the main tourist info office). However at other times of the year you can buy them onsite. Opening and closing hours are also different at different times of the year. There is a website but it is all in French - just use google translate if you don't speak French. Toilets, free parking and git shop all onsite.Read more

Comment: I gave this a terrible rating because a stupid couple during our tour had a two and three year old with them who never shut up and were noisy, yelling and disruptive the whole time while the ignorant parents acted as if nothing was wrong and refused to leave the tour when asked. They should have never been let on the tour and should have been made to leave.The cave authorities should not allow small children on this tour of a dark cave where 40 people have to listen to a guide to figure out what it is all about. Couldn't enjoy it at all.Read more

Comment: Expensive, badly organised and overcrowded guided tour.  It wasn't clear about getting tickets so we had lunch and then went looking for tickets only to find the English tour was not until later in the afternoon.  We manage fairly well with French so took a tour in French.  The guide was boring and monotonal, and just talked talked talked to cover up the fact there wasn't actually all that much to see.  We had been to other caves in the morning - Rouffignac - fantastic!  There were too many people on the tour and we could barely see what he was talking about.  A young couple with a baby couldn't even squeeze into the third room (there is an information display room and then two facsimile rooms).  The guide with the group in front of our group was so loud we couldn't hear what our guide was saying.  However it fulfilled a lifetime ambition and the facsimile is very well done but there are other caves with authentic drawings.  Maybe see this in combination with a real experience!Read more

Comment: The tour lasted forty minutes, this is a true replica of what exists and found by a group of boys in the 1940's. It was reopened as is, in the early '80's, the original can only, yet again be destroyed by man, through oxygen and sunlight.The original place is only 200m away. It is tiny but the fact of where an individual is standing and viewing what promagnam man did  also 17000 years ago.  The tour does remind you of what was taught at school and is actual fact and how it happened.  You could class it as a 'life event', as you have been and seen for real the area in which history happened.Photos are not allowed to be taken, I attach pictures of postcards I bought after of what is shown during the tour.Read more

Comment: Having enjoyed the replica caves at Altamira in Spain last year, we were expecting this to be one of the highlights of our holiday. However, our visit left us feeling rather 'flat.'  Although we went on the tour in English (in April, they seem to do 1 tour a day in English), unfortunately, our guide was very difficult to understand, talked incessantly and practically 'abandoned' us in the cave at the end of the tour so there was confusion as to how we were meant to exit. The group size was larger than for other cave visits (maybe because it was the English tour?) and we were conscious of the next group not far behind us.  The overall effect was of feeling quite 'processed'  and rushed which undermined the quality of the reproductions (which looked good as far as we could tell)  and the 'cave atmosphere' experienced elsewhere.  Outside the site, there is no information (whereas at Altamira, there are informative, multi-lingual displays).  Afterwards, we read that they are building a new Lascaux site due to open in a couple of years and we had the feeling they aren't doing much to maintain this site currently.Read more

Comment: I found it hard to rate this because I thought some things about it were wonderful and others really poor. Hence the 'average' - which really, is the last thing it is.The Lascaux copy is impressive both for what it represents (the pre-historic paintings) and the way in which such a faithful copy has been made. Well worth seeing for both these aspects. One advantage to it being a copy is that there is more lighting than can be used in an original cave - so you get a very good perspective on the extent of the work.Our tour was in French but we weren't given brochures and about half the people were English-speakers I expected we'd get some key points translated, as at Font de Gaume (which worked very well). However, the guide only translated the odd words such as 'red cow' or 'black' which were pretty obvious. He spoke very fast - too fast for my little French (and I heard others say the same). He also told jokes, which from the odd word I understood seemed pretty silly, and made odd noises. Hardly appropriate for somewhere like this, surely?Unless you speak very good French I suggest you ask for an English tour. Maybe then you would get more useful information and less annoyance from the visit.Read more

Comment: Tickets are purchased at the site. Plenty of free parking in a large tree shaded lot. Good tour in English. This is a reproduction of the original caves due to mold etc. getting into the original. There are 30 stairs down to get to the entrance the a sloping floor narrow in one spot. Dark dim lighting adds realism of when it was painted. There are washrooms by the photo shop.No photography or video allowed.Read more

Comment: I tried, but couldn't get over the annoyance of the reproduction experience at Lacaux II. I suppose if you are in a hurry and caving is not your primary reason for being in the Dordogne, a visit to Lascaux is a worthwhile stop to see What Used to Be, the Sistine Chapel-ishness of it all, with gobsmacking prehistoric art piled on top of each other in wild and brilliant profusion, painted by our immediate ancestors some 17,000 years ago. It looks as if they had been painted yesterday. And that's the problem. They were.For the real, authentic experience, do stay another day in the Dordogne. Line up early in the morning for tickets to visit Fond-de-Gaume (breathtakingly beautiful paintings) and Les Combarelles (relief engravings). Both are haunting sites that will last in your memory forever.Read more

Comment: My parents bought our tickets a few days before so we knew exactly when we would be going and there was very little waiting around. Our guide was a very well spoken, and witty, youngish British fellow. He said he was a geology student but all I know is he really "made" the experience for us, especially our 7 year old son who hung on his every word, and we were afraid he might be bored.My parents had gone to Font-de-Gaume on a previous trip and they said that while it was interesting Lascaux was much better, again mainly because of the guide.If you are in the area you really have to do this. Along with canoeing and our Castelnaud tour it was a highlight of the trip.Read more

Since I was a child I've wanted to visit this cave and the fact that it was a reproduction didn't lessen my enjoyment of the site. It was a truly amazing experience!

Comment: Once you get past the fact that you are visiting a replica of the original and get immersed in the place the enormity of what you are visiting sinks in. The original cave and paintings have been faithfully reproduced and you get the full experience of the caves, the paintings and the surrounds. It is far more important that the originals are preserved for future study.The guide spoke excellent english for a french woman but the fact that everyone is standing makes it difficult to see what is being talked about. It would be better if visitors were accommodated on benches at least for a number leaving the walls easier to see.For the adventurious who over rely on a gps the village of Lascaux, charming as it is is a long way from the caves.Read more

Comment: Even if you know what to expect the experience is jaw dropping. And I'm absolutely impressed with the work French put into making exact reconstruction of original cave and offer visitors great experience. Yes, it's a copy but this is a fantastic job and the way you visit it (a large but not too large group every 20 minuts) gives everyone a chance to experience this ancient thing and really get the thrill of seeing something deeply unique. That it's not the original - too all people complaining about this: please use your brain and think for a while that you get the best possible given circumstances. I find it deeply amusing to read such complaints especially form American guests where "ancient" history is not 17.000 B.C. but 1700 A.D. Really... get some life, people!On the practical note: yes, you need to get tickets in Montignac with its tourist office being everything but easily accessible. It frankly doesn't make sense to me to make the trip so complicated to tourists, but... well... it's France, there's many things they simply don't do the most obvious way...Read more

Comment: While the experience to see the pictures, even though they are replicas (understandably so to protect the originals), is worth it, the entire set up is odd.  Having to buy tickets 2 kms from the actual site is odd.  Having such a limited amount of English tours in the middle of summer is odd.  That, on top of a guide that could put the energizer bunny to sleep leaves a lot of room for improvement in general. Read more

Comment: We waited all day for our tour (it was busy even though not yet in peak season) only to be asked to leave once we got into the first cave chamber as our 11 month old baby happened to make a couple of "ga ga ga" noises. They do say before you go in children making a noise will be asked to leave and had he been making a noise then we would have been happy to do so, but he was making no more noise than an adult clearing their throat and it was very occasional...they should change the signs to children making any sort of sound will be expelled.  We were abolsutely flabbergasted by the way we were treated, basically marched out of the fire escape as if we had committed some sort of crime.  We could hear the guide perfectly well and we were right at the back.  Another family whose young children dared to show an interest and ask their parents questions were also asked to leave and similarly escorted.  We were all disgusted. We did get out money back...although we had to be quite forceful to get it.  We were also offered the chance to go round in turn so one of us sat out with our baby whilst the other saw the cave, but that was not really the family experience we were after.Would not recommend at all.Read more

Comment: Lascaux II may well be worth visiting, but the conditions under which one sees it detract from the experience.First, it IS a replica, not the real thing.  That may not matter to some people, but it does to me.  Second, the management crowds people into the fake-cave, so that you are packed in like sardines.  If you are relatively short, like me, that means you see the back of a lot of people's heads, and even though the paintings are up high and on the ceiling, the sheer number of visitors detracts from the experience and makes it hard to see everything.  Certainly it is not possible to look at the paintings from different points of view; I was rendered almost immobile in the crowd.Third, in the interests of moving as many people through as possible, you are given a minimum amount of time to take in the cave, and you have to stay with your group (mine was about 40 people).  There isn't enough time to absorb it.Fourth, the English-language guide provides a kind of snide and not-always-reliable sing-song patter, much of which I found unhelpful.  She had clearly given the talk hundreds of times before, and it showed.Altogether, this site was a disappointment, especially after the enormous buildup it was given.  True, the paintings are magnificent--but they are, in a sense, forgeries, not the originals, and the conditions for appreciating them are lacking.Read more

Comment: This was a good experience. This is a reproduction, and they refresh the paints each year from what a guide at another cave told us. But they did exactly reproduce the original cave, contours and all, and used the same pigments as used in the original. Tickets have to be bought in the town of Montignac; the tourist information office can assist, or in our case, our hotel (Hotel Le Lascaux) arranged tickets and got us in on an English tour. It is not handicapped or stroller friendly. Our baby was carried in, at no cost, but we were warned if she raised a ruckus they would ask me to leave and come back on another tour. All in alll, very interesting, a very well-spoken guide, and a good experience. Well worth it for less than 10 euro a piece!Read more

Comment: We almost skipped this outing since we knew this was a replica of the original cave drawings, and were pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the cave replica and the paintings themselves. (We wanted to go to Font de Gaumme but tickets have been dramatically cut back) Be sure to get a guide in your language as that can make or break the visit---ours was superb. The visit lasts about 40 minutes and yes, it's narrow and crowded, but that (at least to s) made the experience more realistic. Why you cannot but tickets at the site iself but have to buy them in the town of Montignac(about 10-15 minutes away) is nonsensical, but luckily we saw the sign in town before we got there. We bought a double ticket to Lascaux and Le Thot, a "prehistoric museum" that allegedly is supposed to compliment the Lascaux cave. If you don't speak French, forget this museum--none of the movies that show how the replicas were done were in English, so it was wasted on us. Plus, it is another 15-20 minute drive from Lascaux. But Lascaux itself, a great outing. Highly recommend. Four stars simply because Le Thot was a bust.Read more

Comment: This is a replica of the original cave located close by. Unfortunately the original cave was closed to the public in 1963. Replica it may be, but the detail is very impressive. Visits are conducted by guided tours, our tour had about 40 people. This did make it tight in some parts of the cave. The guide began by just speaking in French explaining the history of the cave. Luckily my wife asked if she could also explain in English and she obliged. Without the explanantions in English it would be a nice experience seeing the detail in the cave, but you would not get the whole experience. I haven't seen anything like this in our travels, so I thoroughly enjoyed. The tour took over 1 hour. You are not allowed to take photos in the cave. The guide book which you can purchase in the gift shop is very good.If you are in the area then this is a place to visit.Read more

Comment: The reproduction of the cave is extremely well done. the art is like no other. one needs to take time to view the art forms from several angles and distances as often several sets of animal forms "live in" the same space. This was a boyhood dream and I had read up on this sevral times before coming. Even with a French spaeking guide one can purchase a description in English, and if your patience holds you can ask questions in English and obtain a reply in English. The Village of Montignac is a treasure too and well worth exploring and the Dordonge region holds many other grottos to visit and many charming villages, castles and great cuisine.Read more

Comment: We booked onto the French tour thinking that as a cave, there would be lots to look at (as per a wonderful previous French speaking tour around Grottes de Lacave) and so the language barrier would not be an issue. The lady at the booking desk happily booked us onto the French tour knowing we spoke no French and didn't mention the necessity of waiting for an English tour. Unfortunately, the tour was really a lecture, 25 mins of which took place in a museum style dark room with no writing (and as it was jam packed you couldn't see the exhibits). The guide talked, no time was given to look at anything. If it had been in English it would have been pretty dull too. We were then taken into the cave part, which as we already knew was fake but I could live with that. It was very small and so the remaining time was spent in the one cavern, while she quickly talked away. Even the French visitors were talking amongst themselves as their attention waned. In total it was 65 min rather than 45. I've never rushed out of anywhere so quickly in my life! You could argue I shouldn't have booked a French tour but if there was something more to see this wouldn't be an issue, besides which the other cave gave little leaflets in the most popular languages to help, even though it wasn't needed. I wouldn't even bother with the English tour, there are so many other fascinating (and genuine) caves to explore.Read more

Comment: We can't believe that another person visiting in early April and also English speaking had a better experience than us on 9th April 2013. Lascaux 2 is crammed in to two caves and is a 40 minute long "tour" with about 30-40 people crammed in to each small cave at a time. One woman had to leave because of the feeling of claustrophobia we were so crammed in! The tour was in French even though about 1/3 of the visitors were English speaking (a headset would have helped here). Also, there was no provision for children, who if they didn't cry or talk during the 20 minutes stood in a cave listening to a foreign language they didn't understand were doing better than most of the adults there! None of the English families who visited, whether with young children or not, were at all impressed. A real disappointment!  Roc de St Christophe just down the road was MUCH more impressive and engaging for the family for the same money.Read more

Comment: Never have I been so awed as I was at Lascaux II. I was not expecting the quality of art found here. Although my niece and I had considered visiting Lascaux, we hoped to canoe on the Dordogne River. But, the weather was not cooperating, so we went to Montignac instead. We are so glad we did! The experience was wonderful! The artists who created these cave paintings 17000 years ago were masters. Highly recommend everyone who goes to this area of France include this in their itinerary. It took me 20 years of visiting France to finally see this amazing piece of history. I will probably make another pilgrimage in the future. It is a wondrous sight!Photos are not allowed, but there is a gift shop with postcards of, and books about, the cave paintings. There are English tours at certain times.

Comment: We stopped at Montignac solely to visit Lascaux 11. We nearly didn't go because we'd read some poor reviews about the site being a 'tourist trap' etc. I'm very glad we chose to ignore the hysteria because we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We bought tickets on-site and after a half hour or so wait, joined the English speaking tour. The young tour guide was excellent, very knowledgeable and very funny. The replica caves aren't that big but they are detailed and packed full of mystery, drama and intrigue which left us thinking, wondering and discussing everything we had seen and heard. Although we enjoyed the attraction I haven't given it an 'excellent' rating because I would have liked the lights in the cave to have been dimmed at some point during the tour to allow us to get a better idea of the conditions the artists were working in and I would have liked there to have been somebody demonstrating the techniques, tools and candles that were used to create the paintings, somewhere on the site.Read more

Comment: I went here in the last week of August with 3 boys (5, 7 & 9 yrs).   We booked tickets in Montignac (tickets aren’t sold at the cave) for the 1030 English tour.The cave is a 10-minute drive from the town.  There was no queue at that time of the morning.Our guide was brilliant – the best guide I have ever heard.  The tour hung on his every word.  Even the kids were memorised.  Hopefully all the guides are that brilliant.The cave is a replica of the original, which is a 5-minute walk away.  I though it might be a bit tacky, but they have done a brilliant job on the walls, the paintings and the lighting.   It took me back 17,000 years.  The tour was only about 45 minutes long as the cave fairly is small.The onsite shop is interesting and has many unique pre-historic souvenirs.Read more

Reproduction or not, the art and research done is wonderful.  It truly was a contribution to the archaeological world!My beef: After a very long drive, then waiting in line to get the tickets, then driving to the cave - then arriving to a tour that was so quick - the whole experience was anti-climatic!

Comment: Visited the Lascaux II in July with family.  Of all the places we'd seen in over a month of travel in France and Italy, this has to be one of the low lights.  The Lascaux II is actually a reproduction of the real caves near by.  This is a faithful reproduction (so I'm told) done by the French government and artists because the original caves are being damaged by the streams of tourists like you and me.  While I understand this, it nevertheless lessens the experience for me.  The Lascaux II is made of concrete and painted by artists to reproduce the original.  We had to get the tickets not on site but about 2 km drive in town first.  Then you are given a time to show up to await your turn which was more than 1 hour wait.  You then were herded into the chambers by the guide like cattle as it was quite crowded and narrow.   The entire thing is only really 2 or 3 chambers of painted concrete and for the price, quite a short experience.  No photos allowed either even though it's just a recreation.I'd recommend doing something else as it is not worth the time or expense for this.Read more

Comment: I got the opportunity to visit on a rainy day, and I am fluent in French. That made the whole difference. The site has a reputation for excrutiating long waiting times, and even though you're in a world heritage site, the guides who do not look after English tours have very little English. Our guide did not make a lot of efforts to address the other nationalities, and was pretty annoying repeating the only 2 words he knew in German "schöne Pferd" (nice horse) over and over again. Apart from that, and with the fact that our group was reasonably small, it was a great experience, as a lot of efforts have been put into this facsimile. Arrive early in the morning or book a tour with the last group and have a picnic in the meantime, the neighbouring woods are beautiful. Tickets have to be bought in town, a couple of miles away, when I visited. Might be a deterrent for people depending on public transport. I'd leave the kids somewhere, that would definitely bore them to death.Read more

Comment: These are among the most famous, and oldest, cave paintings in Europe, discovered by some young boys in the 1940s.  The original site was being damaged by tourism, so an exact replica has been created nearby, with a cave hollowed out to exactly the same shape and dimensions and exact copies of the wall paintings being prepared using the same materials as those used in pre-historic times.  This is a great experience and not to be missed if you are in the region.Read more

Comment: This is a copy of the original caves discovered in 1940. Apart from a small shop and some basic unisex toilets there are virtually no facilities here.Dedicated English tours are offered but it is a complicated process to book tickets. You are not allowed to pre book over the phone or online so you have to turn up on the day and hope the timing of the tour fits in with your schedule. The ticket office is in Montignac as tickets cannot be purchased at the caves themselves. The tour itself is made up of four chambers. The first two are preliminary and allow the guide to give a detailed account of the discovery of the caves and painting techniques. Alas this leaves maybe 15 minutes of a 40 minute tour to experience what you have actually come to see. The actual artwork itself is quite detailed and impressive. The first is the Bull Chamber which has a high proportion of artwork and being quite large it is easier to appreciate the art here than in the Axial Chamber which is much narrower. Apparently it took them 5 years to recreate the caves exactly and another 6 years to reproduce the paintings. They must have been paying by the hour. Our favourite was probably the narrow tunnel that connected the two chambers where there was a drawing of a stag and the incredible detail and finery of its antlers and even of its eye.Read more

We all were very glad to have been but we did feel rushed and would have liked just a bit longer to appreciate what we were looking at.

Comment: At this reproduction of Lascaux, the paintings are said to be within 5 mm of the originals.  It is truly superb, with wonderful drawings of bulls, bison, horses, ibex, among others including a mystery animal and some symbols of unknown intent.  The walls of the cave are curved as in the original cave and in the copy you are not ruining the precious artifacts with the humidity that you would add to the space.The tour is efficient but excellently done.  Photos are not allowed.  The main thing that is missing is the feeling that you are in the space where the Cro Magnon did the work.   What you see is so superb that it shouldn't be missed.  The original cave had many engravings incised into the walls and these are not reproduced.  Go to both Rouffignac and Lascaux II in order to get the full experience.Read more

The recreation of the cave and the art work is phenomenal and with the low lighting and cool temps you feel like you are in a cave. The tour started with an explanation of how the cave had been found originally and why it had to be closed to the public then moved into the area with bulls and provided a lot of information on the paintings.  Afterward, the guide asked if our daughter had been able to follow him and if we had any questions.  Definitely a good choice for kids.Read more

Comment: The only hiccup in our experience with Lascaux II was that we were not aware we had to purchase tickets at the tourist bureau, nor did we know where the office was located.Once we descended into the replica grotte, it was clear that we were experiencing something special. The cave drawings/paintings were a treat to behold, and though it's not the "real" Lascaux, it sure feels real! We were not allowed to take photographs, so you'll have to see for yourself!Read more
