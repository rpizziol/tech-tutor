Comment: It is difficult to find the entrance, the elevator is not working due to COVID restrictions. Inside it is very dark and the navigation through the building is very unclear. But this was made by a true architect of name and fame, so who dares to complain??The exhibition was OK, but it lacks a lot of explanation, especially for children. It is not very welcoming, again very dark in all rooms. Some things are interactive: touch the screen, but hey, we're in COVID-regulations so you do not want to touch a screen. Or does the screen not work, because we of COVID-regulations? Anyway, too bad!So this is a nice spot to go, the view is magnificent, the building is very concrete and very dark, but book a tour with a guide, that is much nicer!Read more

Comment: The museum, like the Coa Vllay, is in a far flung corner of Portugal. We visited on a sunny but windy day in January.  It overlooks the confluence of the Duoro and the Coa Rivers and provides an amazing view of the valleys. This is the very latest information on Rock Art in Portugal and as a heritage professional I was delighted to be able to buy a detailed book in the shop.  The art itself is in the valley, where it needs to be seen in its context, so I started with a morning visit to Canada do Inferno site - wonderful, costs extra but worth every penny with a great guide. The museum is really good at adding the bigger picture alongside some real detail. There are some small plaques of carved original material on show and the replicas are very good.  Lots of AV and info for enthusiasts. A highlight for me was the reconstructed paleolithic camp. A brilliant AV where the rock art animals run across the replica rock face. Nice little shop and a great cafe which is essential when you are a long way from anywhere.Read more

Comment: I'm an architect and this building is exceptional; well thought out exhibits, great if austere spaces and industrial aesthetic toilets. the restaurant is one of our best meals in Portugal. I know it's a big call but the food and setting are exceptional. Read more

Comment: A museum without any of the original artefacts but still a very worthwhile experience. The museum contains replicas of several of the original rock carvings found in the valley - together with an explanation of their history and the findings. It really is worth a visit. As well as the museum itself there are great views over the Douro river Read more

Comment: If you are up the Douro River do not miss this. A magnificent modernist high above the Rio Coa. The way the information is displayed is as good as I have seen anywhere I have travelled. Most text has English translation and several videos play a second time with English text. There are several wonderfully presented replicas of the prehistoric rock art.We first took the jeep tour to one of the sites with an archaeologist. She was engaging and we found it interesting to see the actual art works on the cliff walls. It is a tough walk along a narrow rough 'goat track' - meeting the shepherd herding his goats with his dogs was a bonus. At Euro15 it was a great experience although in the sunlight I struggled to see some of the images in full - but the museum made it all clear afterwardsRead more

Comment: You can find this modern museum in the city of Vila Nova de Foz Coa, it is on the outsider of the city in a rural area, and there is enough parking for the car. The Museum has been created into the year 2011. The Foundation's main objective is to promote the integrated development of the region through the cultural project of archaeology in progress, bringing together partners and private economic agents, highlighting the importance of the culture economy and its contribution to the country's well-being. It is filled with copies of the archaeology pieces from the region, this in order to safeguarding the cultural and natural heritage in the area of the Archaeological Park of the Côa Valley. It is a nice experience and you can learn allot about from it. But anyhow it is not comparable with the original caves and pieces, but worth the visit.Read more

Comment: This was a great find along the way. We were surprised by the modern style architecture of the museum. The guided tour helped keep us engaged as we walked they the galleries. The content matter of the exhibit was not our thing; but we were impressed by the over all experience of the space. You will be stunned by the visual impact of the scenery contested with the magnificent building incorporated into the environment. Read more

Comment: It is rare in my experience to be so close to our ancestors of 25000 years ago, and see expressions of their human intelligence. This museum and the nearby rock engravings complement each other, so I suggest seeing both. The museum is a striking minimalist building with subdued lighting that gives a cave-like atmosphere. The exhibits are well-presented and explained, including English translations.Read more

Comment: I absolutely agree with all the glowing reviews. (And I'm not a big fan of Brutalist architecture, but this one knocked me out!) However, when we were planning our trip to Portugal, especially to visit the Coa Valley rock art, I ran into trouble.Please note that my "review" is not a complaint about the museum, it's a heads-up to any other travelers such as ourselves, who like to make plans in advance. So...We were in Foz Coa from Wednesday, October 5 to Saturday, October 8 2016. This was after "the season," so my problems may have been be due to date late in the year. Or, they may have been due to cutbacks in the museum's budget. At any rate, L--- and I planned our trip and booked lodgings and plane flights far in advance, as we usually do. I contacted the museum (via email, the only way to book site tours) beginning in the first week of September--a month in advance. It took weeks of back-and-forthing (waiting days for each email to be answered) to establish that during our four-day-stay in Foz Coa, we could only be booked for tours to two of the three sites. And that no Nocturnal Visits were given during October. I was in a panic! It never occurred to me we would have trouble getting tours during the shoulder season.Luckily, the museum gave me a list of private tour operators, and one of them came through with flying colors. She was willing to take us to all three sites, and on a Nocturnal Visit, which was essential and amazing. (I will provide her name on request.) So we ended up taking six tours (to the three sites), four with the private, and two with the museum guides. I realize that most people won't be so obsessed with seeing ALL the rock art as we are. ;^) But if you are, and want to be thorough, please be aware that you might have to begin planning months in advance, at least, outside the summer tourist season. Thanks for listening!Read more

Comment: A small museum with interesting exhibits and replicas of the stone carvings fron the nearby Vale de Coa archaeological park.  We enjoyed the visit and it gave us information and helped us appreciate the guided visit to the carvings that we booked for the afternoon.  There is a good restaurant on site as well - you can have a full lunch or have a sharing plate of cheese and meat if you want something lighter.Read more

Comment: The museum was great, we were really excited for the Palaeolithic tour but unfortunately reservations were required. Nevertheless the staff was very friendly although reception wasn't fluent in English and neither was the man giving informal tours inside the museum. One employee did come speak to us in English when she saw us a little lost trying to make sure we didn't miss a room. Luckily for my boyfriend I speak Portuguese and could translate when needed. There was a temporary Korean exhibition inspired by côa and all exhibition labels are translated in English. My favourite part was the light tunnel with palaeolithic drawings be sure not to miss it!

Comment: Arriving to Foz Coa at 5 PM I was shocked with the building where the museum is. A  M-A-S-T-E-R-P-I-E-C-E OF A-R-C-H-I-T-E-C-T-U-R-E.The landscape... the silence... the sunset ... PARADISE.Received at the reception by a very very nice lady, went to visit the museum -don´t forget to take pictures in the tunnel with wird lights, because you´ll get wonderful ones-. I wasn´t sure the visit would be a nice tour. It was !After visiting, went to the restaurant where I had one of best meals ever had, and after that, went to visit the "gravuras" at night -book in advance- with Vasco, one of the best lover emotional guides I have ever seen. The proof is that we arrived back to the museum at 1 A.M!!! It shows how amazing the visit was. AMAZING!!!For several days I didn´t stop thinking how increadable the visit was.Read more

Comment: We telephoned two days previously to reserve a place on the tour to see the rock art, and assured the receptionist that we could walk for one kilometre.  She asked again whether we were able to walk for a kilometre.   On the day, after a journey of 140 km, we arrived at the museum twenty minutes before the appointed time of 10h00, and paid for a visit to the museum and for the guided tour.  There were eight of us visitors in the jeep, and we enjoyed the roasting two-hour tour of one of the sites of rock art in the valley of the Côa.  On our return to the museum building, we went down to the well appointed café to refresh before visiting the museum exhibits.As we approached the museum exhibition halls, the girl who had sold us the tickets for the tour and museum visit informed us quite breezily that they were just about to shut for lunch, and that we could not visit the museum until 14h00.  When we protested that the entrance of the museum shows that it is open all day and that the printed material shows that it is open until at least 13h30, we were brazenly informed that the right information appears on the museum website.  At 12h40, we could see that many of the employees at this museum were gathering in the entrance hall for their trip to their lunch.  Not being able to face a wait of 80 minutes, a museum visit and then a journey of 140km back to our hotel, we asked for the return of our entrance money and received it.  As they left noisily for their lunch trip, they actually left open the entrance to the retail area, and it was possible for anyone to descend to that level in the lift.This museum is modern and concrete, and its blocky construction apparently reflects the geological fault line which allowed the valley of the Côa to be formed.  It must have cost millions to build in this remote area of the remotest part of the Alto Douro.  It is probably quite interesting.  But our experience is that you cannot make a field visit with the excellent guide, and also visit the museum without a major hiatus in your day.Further, it may have been correct that we walked a kilometre to see the rock art; but we also descended tens of metres on rocky, uneven and sometimes slippery pathways, and of course had to walk back up them.  Even for the able bodied, this tour required surefootedness. It astounds me that an expensive and modern construction in the middle of nowhere should make itself unavailable for visits just when those who have been on the guided walk are ready to visit it.  It is not as though there was an army of visitors - I counted sixteen different visitors during the time we were there.  But what really frustrated me was the sheer arrogance of the staff, and their contemptuous dismissal of our concerns.The upshot?  We left exasperated and angry.  And instead of enthusing and learning more about this world class heritage of rock art in a top-class museum, I find that I could not care less.  I shall certainly never go there again.Read more

Comment: We visited the Museum at Coa Valley. The replicas were very, very good, and the interpretation added greatly to the experience. We were unable to book space on a tour to the actual sites, which were not advised for us due to the extremely hot temperatures in the Summer. The restaurant provided an excellent lunch.  We got "lost" in the old town of Foz Coa on the way, as the signage to the museum is not always easily seen en route.Read more

Comment: The area of Foz Coa is a world heritage park with many paleolithic rock drawings.It is advisable to start by visiting the museum, outside the town of Vila Nova de Foz Coa. A real gem. Then book a tour to visit the open air paleolithic rock engraving art. A very surprising experience.Read more

Comment: Try to book the night tour. During the day you are limited to the tilt of the Sun. At nigh with artificial light you can simulate every position of the Sun, only then you can see all the wonders of this magiclike monument.Read more

Comment: An unforgetable experience for adults and children ! I recommend you to visit first one of the sites (Penascosa, for instance, during the morning), and afterwards the very modern Museum, plenty of multimedia devices, with one of the excellent guides, that will take you in a very interesting trip back to the Prehistoric times ! During the Summer some night visits are organized for small groups of visitors. If you have the opportunity to participate, do not miss it. You will have the opportunity to discover a whole new world of very tiny engravings, not visible with direct sun light.Read more

Comment: There are three sites that can be visited, we went to the one at Pensacosa, trips starting at the Parque Arqueológico do Vale do Côa (PAVC) centre in Castelo Melhor. First, and very important, book a place in advance.While we were there we met people who had turned up the previous day hoping for a place and had been unable to go on the tour. We also saw people who had turned up that day and had had to book a future date. The tours are via a 4WD vehicle and strictly limited to what the vehicle can carry, 8 at a time.Bookings can be made by phone or email. We used email three days previously, English plus a Google translation in Portuguese, and got a reply, in perfect English, the following day.The site itself is quite a way from Castelo Melhor, several miles along a rough track, hence the need for the 4WD. Our driver / guide worked full time for the PAVC, spoke good English and was very knowledgeable about the carvings and the history of the area. She did mention that sometimes they need to employ local people to run the tours and they pretty much work from a script. Your experience may therefore vary.The Pensacosa site is in a valley by the banks of the river Coa, Walking is easy and the carvings are not far from where the vehicle stops. One set of carvings is at the top of a flight of rock steps, but most people should be able to get to them. The others have very easy access. The carvings themselves are not easy to see, the tours are timed to get the best illumination from the sun on them, but they still need a bit of explanation from the guide before you get your eye in and start to recognise what you are seeing.Altogether, it's an excellent trip if you are interested in archaeology / pre-history. It's still pretty good even if you don't have a special interest. It's not often that you get to see 20,000 year old artwork still in it's original setting..Read more
