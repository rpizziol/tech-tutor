Comment: Really good. I wasn’t sure beforehand whether it was worth visiting a reproduction, but in hindsight it totally was.  It brought cave paintings to life in a way that you can’t appreciate from a small, flat photo. For a start they are huge. And the intricacies in the way they’ve been painted, the techniques that were used, and the way the figures had been planned to fit with the shapes of the rocks, are astounding. The reproduction is like being in the real cave, from the look and feel of the ‘rock’ to the temperature, acoustics and atmosphere. It’s not at all like looking in a glass display box at a museum. The tour guide was brilliant, pointing out a whole new level of things that we would never had noticed. Also, slightly trivial, but the on-site cafe was excellent, offering a meal of a quality you will not find at a tourist attraction in Britain! Two criticisms: at times it felt extremely crowded, with way more people packed into a small cave than is probably sensible (even with mandatory face masks and the pass sanitaire). We ended up quite nervous about the possibility of catching Covid there and not being able to travel home. Also, when I booked online we could only see tours conducted in French available on the website.  But when we arrived there clearly were English tours available too. The staff were superbly helpful and moved us from the French tour that we had booked onto an English one instead.Read more

Comment: Since we are not allowed as mere mortals to ever witness the inner walls of the original Lascaux cave, Lascaux IV is the second best option. Recreated to amazing detail, including temperature, humidity and acoustics, this allows you to experience what those boys saw when they first entered the cave back in 1940.Tour guide in English was very knowledgable and extremely funny.Read more

Comment: The prehistoric cave paintings at Lascaux had been on our bucket list for many years, and we did not know if we would ever get to check it off, until this year. During our recent visit to France, this was one of our priorities.  Now, I know, you purists out there will say that we are seeing a reproduction of the original paintings and this is true.  But, since the populace can no longer see the originals do to the bacterial damage resulting from the exhalations of so many previous visitors, and the reproductions are so accurately depicted, it was a moot point with us.  Yes, we could have gone to some of the smaller caves in the area that can still be visited to see original paintings, but the Lascaux paintings are the most extensive and spectacular, so that is what we wanted to see.First, and most importantly, let me tell you that if you are driving on your own in a rental with GPS, make sure you get the correct Lascaux in the GPS system! Now, what we didn’t know, and what nobody tells you, is that there is more than one Lascaux in France. And our GPS (witheringly given the name Karen by us) decided to take us to the remotest Lascaux on the map. I’m not kidding.  We ended up in dueling banjo country traversing roads that were nothing more than rutted farm tracks.  We kept saying, “Surely this isn’t the way to one of the region’s major tourist attractions.”  And, boy howdy, it sure wasn’t.  Nobody spoke English, and my French is limited to “Ou est la toilette?” and “Deux cafe, s’il vous plait,” which aren’t much help in these circumstances.The one time we stopped in hope of getting directions, the farmer started shaking his head before I even got Parler-vous outta my mouth and shut the doors and shutters of his falling down farm house.  I swear I heard banjo music over Karen’s snickering as I hastily got back into the car. We were beginning to feel like Karen’s prisoners. I mean, we didn’t know where we were (totally lost) and had to rely upon her demented decisions.  I re-entered Lascaux into the GPS system, and Karen, that cow, finally took us to the correct town.  Obviously, we had missed our reserved tour time (we booked tickets online the night before), but fortunately, the kind young man at the information booth at the cave’s entrance understood our dilemmas, and although we were two hours past our scheduled time he put us on the next English speaking tour.  Apparently, we weren’t the first visitors who trusted Karen’s GPS family and they also ended up in Dueling Banjos Lascaux, because he smiled and nodded his head when he heard our excuse.But, and I don’t say this easily, the trip was worth the hassle. We were awed by the technique, the use of space, and the way the artists showed movement (shaking heads, moving feet).  Outstanding.  It was very informative, and I recommend it without reservation (if you are using GPS get the right town). The guides know their history, and the museum at the end of the tour has interactive displays that cover the research into the paintings and how they were recreated in the current setting.  It was a fascinating visit and even with our adventure getting to the caves it was well worth the effort!Read more

Comment: We had a look online and noticed that some tours were in English, some in French, so we decided to go for the tour in English. Luckily we booked it online as it sold out and people had to wait for the next tour or try another day. Advice: book online so you get the tour and time you want. The guide was really interesting and pointed out things that we would have missed (or missed the significance of) had he not been there. Although not the original caves, they had been recreated really well and you could easily forget where you were. The story of how the caves were found was really good, it is amazing that they managed to stay hidden for so long. Once the guided tour was over there was an area with lots of different "stations" each covering a different topic and you could wander around at your leisure listening on headphones to narratives that kicked in at each station. We don't usually buy souvenirs but we really enjoyed the visit and hit the gift shop, which had some really nice stuff. The visit was not over yet - we headed to the restaurant for a bite to eat. We had a really nice meal - coq au vin - before heading back to the car (lots of parking spaces). We really enjoyed our day.Read more

Comment: Locals recommended that we go to Lascaux II but on arrival in the early afternoon discovered that the only tour in English took place each day at 11.30 a.m.  Lascaux IV, a modern interpretative centre that opened in 2016, is only a couple of kilometres away and there was an English tour at 3.40 p.m.Initially I thought that the 20 Euro admission was a bit steep, but it is a faithful recreation of 90% of the cave (Lascaux I, closed since 1983 to preserve the delicate rock art) and the tour unfolds using digital images, sound and a gradual reveal of the beauty and mysteries of the rock paintings as the guide takes the group through.  The tour itself lasts for an hour and then you receive an interactive digital tablet in the museum / workshop where you can discover any amount of detail about the cave, the paintings and, how the paintings were done.  The tablets respond to the different zones in the museum and I found it difficult to operate initially but after persevering with understanding how the tablet worked, it provided a goldmine of information.   The only real disappointment was the 3D movie which really added nothing to the experience.  We spent nearly three hours inside the complex and its cool interior was a welcome escape from the 38 degrees outside.  Very worthwhile.Read more

Comment: Lascaux is the most famous of the prehistoric caves, but the cave itself isn't open to the public. Lascaux IV is a full-scale reproduction of the cave -- and touring the reproduction is an interesting way to get the experience of what it might have been like 17000 years ago. The most interesting part of the museum is the set of exhibits after the cave visit -- the "studio". It is a bunch of good interactive exhibits that help you learn more about the caves and prehistoric times.Read more

Comment: My wife, 3-year-old daughter and I enjoyed our visit, largely thanks to the dramatic and humorous guided tour by Christian. The fact that this is a reproduction does not detract from the awe-inspiring and mystifying nature of the cave paintings. In fact, for those with young children, this is actually better as it’s much safer than visiting a real cave. We visited the Domme cave earlier in our trip, and while it was a fantastic experience, I almost slipped while carrying my daughter who was too frightened to walk on her own.There are areas of improvement, however. The English tour starts at 11 a.m., and the guided tours lasts 1 hour. Visitors are then expected to continue their visit to the other sections of the facility, which takes around 2 hours more to appreciate. When I spoke with the lady in the gift shop, as there was no one manning the exit where you deposit the headphones and tablets, she said that normally you are not allowed to return to the gallery area once you leave, even just to eat. I pointed out that I spoke to another staff member prior to the tour who said it was possible, along with our guide. We returned to the exit, which was then manned by Melanie. She confirmed that it was possible to step out to the restaurant and return, provided that you register your name in their logbook along with the size of the group. Fortunately I was able to discuss in French as this facilitated the discussion. It just seems unreasonable to expect people to properly appreciate all the facility has to offer beyond the lunch hour, without being able to stop and have lunch, particularly those traveling with young children. This appears to be a serious oversight by the facility’s management.Speaking of lunch, the restaurant is overpriced and the food was a disappointment relative to the fantastic eateries all around the region. We spent EUR 52 for a shared starter of foie gras, the plat du jour beef dish, burger, one glass of wine, and one orange juice.The first part of the galleries was very interesting, wherein portions of the cave are highlighted and presented through fancy multimedia presentations. The technology does trip on itself though - the tablets are awkward to use, even for someone like me who spends hours on his iPad. Some audio tracks stopped before they were complete. The tablets are meant to recognize when you’re in the vicinity of a certain exhibit and will load the appropriate features, including the audio commentary. Oftentimes though the audio track would start midway, likely due to another visitor having previously played the track inadvertently by walking past.The 3-act multimedia film was very fancy, but struck me as superfluous and an unnecessary expense on the part of the facility. I saw little added value from this presentation.The 3D film was also very impressive, but was overly philosophical. It also wasn’t clear which caves and paintings the film was referring to, as it seemed to be referring to prehistoric art in general. Again, this cinema with fancy 3D glasses is completely superfluous. It would’ve been a great attraction for kids if the content weren’t too esoteric.The VR station was very impressive, allowing users to don VR goggles to explore the cave. It was very realistic, but as with VR technology in general, it can induce nausea after prolonged use.Finally, this facility omitted to discuss what is known about the people themselves who painted the cave walls. I understand that very little is known, but it would nonetheless be interesting to be presented with the various hypotheses about the people and their reasons for painting the cave walls.Overall, I recommend visiting this site.Read more

Comment: Even though this is a replica, it is a fantastic experience.  The first view of all the paintings took my breath away.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable and spoke good English.  He was very responsive to the many questions that were asked.  If I were in this area again, I would go back and highly recommend this experience to everyone.  We also went to Font de Gaume which is the original cave.  This was also a terrific experience though very different to Lascaux.Read more

Comment: This is an amazing museum experience.  There is a complete reconstruction of the Lasceaux cave complex.  The prehistoric art work is unique - 20,000 years old.  You have to book on line and we opted for an English tour.  Tours get booked up quickly so plan ahead....... Allow 2 1/2 hours and there's a good restaurant for lunch.  Park in P1 but use loos in the centre not the car park!Read more

Comment: Lascaux 4 is a cave replica and museum. We booked ahead for the English tour and our guide Arnold was excellent. The first part of the experience is a guided tour with headphones through the amazing cave replica - it is as though you are in a real cave. After the guided tour, there is a museum with life sized panels of the cave paintings. They furnish you with an iPad like device with info on each panel. There is also the ability to take photos in the museum with the device and email them home, but I just used my camera phone. There are no photos allowed in the cave replica. Had lunch in their cafe afterwards.Read more

Comment: Having studied Prehistory many years ago we were excited to visit the amazingly recreated replica of Lascaux IV The organisation was faultless from the ability to book an English speaking tour online to the way the visit was structured Our quite Christian was superb and his passion really added to the visitThe cave is an incredibly accurate reproduction of the real cave. Christian really explained a lot about the technique of painting, the variety of animals and symbols and the different theories about why/ how they were paintedAfter the tour he held a QA session and answered all the questions the group could askThe next section was a large hall where the various section of the were recreated in a clever arrangement so you never felt crowded Here you were given a small table that provided a map of the area and a commentary There were also addition features such as highlighting animals and learning extra details, the ability to electronically manipulate  “found”objects such as stone lamps, embedded videos and the ability to take photosIf this wasn’t enough there were two theatres, one 3D, and temporary art exhibitionsWe spend 31/2 hours of wonder and learning in what has to be one of the most innovative museums in the worldRead more

Comment: Really enjoyed this new replica, had visited Lascaux II twenty years ago.  A wonderful way to experience a cave that is not and cannot be opened for public visits.  Had an English tour.  There are actually 2 parts to the visit.  One part is the guided tour part through the replica.  Then there is a large area called the "workshop" which is actually areas where the main painting groupings are displayed and replicated again and for which visitors can take pictures to their hearts content.  The audio visual enhancements are very interesting and informative.  The scientific explanations about the original inhabitants, how the paintings were done, and the damage from visitors are well done.Read more

Comment: We had high expectations of our visit having read reviews. The new building is stunning and they have spend millions. The first part of our tour with an English speaking guide was excellent - especially the explanation of the area in prehistoric times, the brief movie that was part of the guided tour and the visit to the replica.  We were impressed by the magnitude of the cave paintings, and the size. Sadly, we were at the back of our group so missed out on some of the lighting of the paintings that were being discussed.  Sure, this isn’t the real thing, but it was impressive.The next stage of the interactive museum was ok - but the use of the ipad was not intuitive and they could have included so much more interpretation using screens that multiple people could watch - how were pigments made, how were they applied, how were scaffolding’s put in place etc.  Engage the public! The 2 theater experiences were awful - so much money spent and again, not that much info provided. The 3 D movie was ridiculous - again, not information, just speculating and talking to our ancestors about “what were you thinking” etc. Sorry to be so harsh, but for the millions they spent this movie should have been absolutely stunning.Had I known all these we would have visited one of the other real grottes, or the National Museum of Prehistory in Les Eyzies or walked under those gorgeous cliffs.All in all a long day. Plus with the 11 am tour we were out too late to catch lunch in Montignac.Good luck!Read more

Comment: We really enjoyed this after wanting to visit for many years. They have done an excellent job of recreating the caves and images and the modern IT touches are mostly very well done (but the French can be a bit pretentious sometimes on the commentary front).  It was dark and cool and you really did feel a bit like a time traveller (or at least I did).Read more

Comment: We've been to the Dordogne many times, and have always given Lascaux a miss because we've been told it's so crowded. This year, with Lascaux IV fully open, we decided to give it a go. And we're glad we did. We booked on the Monday and managed to get 4 places on the English tour for the Friday afternoon - if we'd thought ahead, I'd have booked it from England before we left. The instructions tell you to arrive 15 minutes beforehand. I would suggest allowing a little extra, as the car parks are just slightly too small for the number of visitors. We went round both before finding a spot as someone pulled out, and there were about fifteen to twenty other cars also circulating. The tours go exactly at the time stated. Our guide was fab. He spoke in English, and unlike many guided tours, he'd not learnt his speech off-pat. He was clearly working his English out as he spoke, which made for a more informal and more interesting tour. The first part is done with the guide, with headphones for all, so you can hear your guide however far back you happen to be. The second part, in the museum, is done with the tablet device. There's a video in the centre before you start your tour, showing you how to operate this, and the guide shows you as well before leaving you. It's supposed to load up automatically as you get near each section of the museum, but ours rarely did. No problem, as we'd been shown how to load the information ourselves. Really informative. And you can take pictures with it, and then download them at home - a maximum of 20. The museum section includes a second reproduction of the paintings you've just passed, but with more information, and the ability to move further away from them. This means you can spend longer looking at them, without a guide moving you on.We avoided the 3D cinema, and went to the interactive art bit at the end, where there was a temporary exhibition and we were also able to curate our own exhibition on the display screens. It's not the real thing, but it's brilliantly done.Read more

Comment: Although the visit is a tour of the replica caves and museum, it has been so well done that the sense of visiting real caves is very convincing. This has enabled the tourist to get the feel of the place and learn lots about the cave paintings without them being damaged, thereby allowing them to be preserved for future generations.The whole experience exceeded our expectations and is well worth the €20 entrance fee. We were there for a whole morning and came out feeling inspired. Would highly recommend it if you’re in the area.Read more

Comment: We did the English language tour through the cave which was great. The cave reproduction is incredible and the guide was very knowledgable. My only complaint would be that although the cave is very well lit, it would have been nice to experience some of the art in a flickering light that the artists would have had. It was then onto the exhibit, where we were given a small tablet and told that this would guide us through. All I can say is that from a group of 8 (all <30 years old) none of us could get it to work properly. It was extremely frustrating and I was left craving something to read. The video exhibits were particularly dull and the audio for two of the group didn't work (through the tablet). The 3D experience was fun though. Tl:Dr - the cave was great, but the technology in the exhibition was awful and which left us all extremely frustratedRead more

Comment: I wanted an English tour as most of party don't speak enough French. English tour at 11.00 was full online the day before, so booked French tour at 11. 18. Arrived at 10.30 & ticket office offered me 2 alternative tours in English that had not been online. Switched to the 12.41 English tour, & headed into Montignac to pass the time. This was a good decision. If you can't understand French well, the first hour inside the replica cave will be difficult. Our English speaking guide (Arnold?) was very informative. The first hour you have to be very quiet, speaking only in whispers. The 7year old was OK. I wouldn't personally take any child younger than this if they can't be quiet for an hour, you know your own child! Otherwise you will stop others from hearing the guide! We all enjoyed the first hour. Next part was the self guided interactive tour using the tablet. OK for the teenager. OK for the 9 year old (switched the tablet to age 7-10 mode), had to switch tablet to age 4-6 mode for the 7 year old as 7plus was too advanced for him. The grandparents in their seventies really struggled with the touch screen tablet & had to be assisted all the way through this section. They are not complete technophobes but this was beyond them. As a result they found this a tiring way of learning about the caves. Great for the other party members though. The 3D film was a hit, as was the VR. Gallery section was more interesting for adults, but children had had enough by then so we had to leave. Spent approx 2 - 2 and a half hours there. A good use of a wet day. Added bonus of unexpected visit into Montignac. Glad we had been down a 'real' cave in Domme beforehand so the kids had experience of that before the replica version. Read more

Comment: The French have done this really well. The facility looks like an impressive futuristic concrete building surrounded by an array of wild grass in the foreground and pine trees on the hill behind the facility. They've re-modelled the actual cave and paintings to enable this Homo Sapien generation to view the works of our predecessors. The Orix, Horse and Stag feature predominately here. We had a marvellous guide in Christian (Chris) who took us on a journey -back in time- and then to the 1940s when the cave was discovered by Robot the dog and the ensuing 4 teenagers. We were able to listen to Chris' commentary via headset and with the assistance of his laser pointer, we were able to comprehend what he was describing.There is also a section beyond the caves where adults and children can engage in interactive presentations and also view film and even 3D clip. Well worth the experience for people of all ages. In excess of 2 hours. Free off-street parking is also available.Our visit was a couple however it is also suitable for families so long as the little Homo Sapiens are okay with the initial hour. It will get better for them.Read more

Comment: Before going to Lascaux IV we had seen the actual cave art in Font du Gaume, Abri Cap Blanc and Les Combarelles.- all of which are 20's on a scale of 1 to 5.  I urge people who can to go to a real cave - we also went to Rouffignac which does not require the early wait in line of the other 3.That said, we thoroughly enjoyed Lascaux IV.  There is much more art here than in any other cave.  Our guide was excellent.  After the cave you can spend as much time as you wish in the museum and you can take photos there, which we enjoyed.  I even learned to use the interactive iPad and was able to ask the employees some questions.I read a few reviews before we left that said you'd never know you were in a reproduction.  I totally disagree with that.  It is not a real cave.  It's not as dark and you don't have to squeeze through narrow spaces.  It is still excellent, but don't feel like you've had a real cave experience.My husband missed hearing most of the tour narrative because his headphones didn't work.  Be sure to check them out well before you leave on the tour.I have a huge thank you to give to Lascaux.   I got my dates mixed up and we went the day after the reservation.  They just let us go ahead.  That was so kind of them.  I wouldn't try it on purpose - I think they saw the genuine surprise and horror on my face, but they were so helpful.We ate one of our favorite lunches at a picnic table at a tiny cafe built into the garage of a home close to parking lot 2.  The owner spoke reasonable English and it was fun to talk to a local person.  Plus the chicken and dessert were very good.It is such a shame that the real cave was almost ruined by installing a ventilation system and letting millions of people visit, but we can be grateful for this replica.Read more

Comment: My parents and I visited Lascaux IV this afternoon, in May 2019.  The complex and the recreation work were undeniably impressive and the information interesting, but the overall experience was very commercialized.  Tours are conducted in large groups (approximately 30 people) and the guide seemed more trained to recite a script than truly passionate about the prehistoric art; the large group and the level of detail were something of a letdown.Earlier in the day we were lucky enough to get tickets to the Grotte de Font-de-Gaume, where one can still see original cro magnum cave art, which was one of the most impressive sites I’ve seen in 20 years of travel.  That likely factored into the disappointment with (and “disneyland“ feel of) Lascaux IV.  I would recommend touring Lascaux IV before visiting other cro magnon sites for an overview and introduction, but be advised that it is large and catered to tourists though.Read more

Comment: We’re able to get in on an English speaking tour. Discovered in 1940 by some young lads and their dog, this reproduction of the original art is magnificent.

Comment: One must compliment France for investing the money and talent to create this beautiful treasure for us to see. The paintings and etchings were wonderful to view in this exact recreation of their original spaces. Our guide, Julien, spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable about Lascaux then and now. He was able to answer every question put to him. However, the tablet and headset I was given needed charging as they gave out shortly after the tour began. I was therefore not able to view and learn from the supplemental explorations at the conclusion of the formal tour.  In addition, I did not always hear the guide unless I was close to him AND because there were so many rude guests who talked constantly during the tour. One mother, from a neighboring European country, had signed her family up for the English tour and did simultaneous translation into their native language the entire time. (Tours in their native language are available on a regular basis.) Other parents with small children carried on a running commentary with them while the guide was speaking. I was quite put off by all these visitors’ lack of consideration for the other guests, and their disrespect for our fine guide.This tour is not appropriate for children under school age or who cannot be quiet for 45 minutes. Also, I wish that Lascaux IV would have their guides as part of their intro request silence during the cave tour for the enjoyment of all visitors.Read more

Comment: The english tours are at 11am every day.  The caves in the museum are very exact replica's because the actual caves would be destroyed by tourist traffic. This the the best of the lascaux sites to go to if you can only see one. The prehistoric Art is much more profound than you might imagine.  The museum is an amazing building and very well organized.  Spent 2.5 hours there on a rainy day and was moved by the experience.  Tour starts with a verbal tour then continues with hand held computers and ear hone than present material and movies in english as well as translates the theater experiences.Read more

Comment: We had a wonderful visit to Lascaux IV in late November. There were NO crowds the day we visited, and since it was the off season, we could not get a tour in English on the day we came. But English recorded guides were available, and were particularly helpful when we visited the museum following the tour through the cave. Of course this is not the real cave, but one forgot that because the reconstruction was so well executed. After the tour through the cave, we could see specific panels in the museum and listen to descriptions of how the artwork was created. This cave, as well as Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave in the Ardèche department of southern France, were the highlights of our trip to France. I saw Lascaux II years ago, and the museum exhibitions were an incredible improvement to the visit.

Comment: This was the highlight of my whole week.  Seeing individual works of art is not the same as walking into a room and being surrounded by cave art, just like people were thousands of years ago.  Excellent use of technology later in the tour that lets people dive into learning more in whatever language they choose, and there are separate systems for children.  Fabulous day here!Read more

Comment: Very sceptical until we got there! A copy yes - an amazing experience nevertheless yes. Good guide -  plus self guiding tablet that we wished we were 16 years old to be able to use fuller. Fascinating place and a very well done vksitor experience. Thoroughly recommended - as is the cafe for lunch - great service and very good food.Read more

Comment: We visited the Dordogne with the purpose of seeing the prehistoric caves and enjoying the wines.  Our morning spent here at Lascaux 4 was perfect.  The reconstruction of the original Lascaux caves which are limited to research and preservation is amazing.  The accompanying exhibits enhance your experience.  Our guide moved us through the caves easily and with complete explanation.  His English was perfect.  Be sure to see all the exhibits after the tour.  It would be nice to have an overview film before the tour to set up the experience.Read more

Comment: First of all the signs are inadequate to find the parking spots, especially for handicapped persons.  Upon departure we find we could have parked in the spots allocated for buses, closer to the entrance. Alas, too late.I have visited Lascaux II years ago and had an extraordinarily experience.This visit was extremely disappointing.First of all the building is a huge concrete monster, not welcoming and preparing you for a tour back to past. Too late, the French constructed this and we have to live with this.Reserved a wheelchair on line line before the visit. Great, but it stopped right there. Guide did not acknowledge the need for a handicapped person, like being first in line, not to hurt persons rolling down the slopes, and be able to watch the sites. The tablets provided are a joke. Sporadically you get some information in English. You would be better off having a paper instruction in various languages.I know what your standard response will be, so don’t bother.  I know you don’t care one way or the other, since you have millions of visitors each year. But maybe this review will make you consider to improve conditions for future visitors. I will never return.Read more

Comment: This is a reproduction of the original cave and we were a bit reluctant to go as my husband had seen the original cave a few months before it closed. However, it was well worth the visit - one of the highlights of our trip to France - with the reproduction being an exact copy of the original and you really thought you were in a cave. The presentation by our English speaking guide was excellent. Make sure you book tickets for Lascaux IV and not Lascaux II. Lascaux IV has other exhibitions and films as well as the amazing cave. Allow at least 2 hours to see it all. You can only book online at least 24hrs in advance so we phoned, found out the times of the English speaking tours, and had a choice of several that afternoon. Everything about the Lascaux experience was excellent.Read more

Comment: This has been so well thought through, in construction, presentation, logistics. So well delivered with the tour guides, the exhibits, the (weird and psychedelic) film shows, the technology. The experience, is not to be missed, the only part I didn't like was the modern art exhibition, but I don't like modern art - the rest is mind-blowingly good.Read more

Comment: We visited both Lascaux IV and Lascaux II.  IV first which made us want to go back in and visit again but the booking office recommended Lascaux II to try for a new experience which was a fabulous choice hence I am going to comment on both sites in this review to give a complete picture.  Lascaux IV is in the main building and covers 95% of the original paintings.  The tour is an hour.  You are given a gadget to use at the end of the tour to use in the 'museum' after your visit to the caves.  This explains amongst other things, how the replica was made, the layers of animals, paints used, explanations as to what the paintings mean and heaps of other interesting facts including videos.  You have to use all of the buttons on the gadget otherwise you miss out on a lot of this information (Make sure you remember this as we were were not told this on our guide and would have missed heaps).As you are only in the actual caves of IV for an hour, you get a very high level (albeit good) review from the guide, however once you have been through the 'museum' (we were in there three hours), you understand so much more and you want to go back in and see the paintings again (unfortunately you can't unless you buy another ticket).  The museum side is amazing.  As a family, we don't give our child gadgets so my heart sank when we were each given one but I couldn't fault it.  Our child was completely engaged and after three hours, still didn't want to leave.  To be honest, as adults, the gadget gave us so much information with the museum displays, I couldn't fault it.With this in mind, we booked Lascaux II (if you book a second visit, your ticket price is reduced to 6 Euros per adult) and Tatiana our English speaking guide was phenomenal.  She bought Lascaux II alive for us.  She talked about the characters involved in the discovery of the caves and we learnt so much more (especially as we'd already been in Lascaux IV and now understood what we were looking at).  Tatiana gave us the human element with so much more explanation and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her.For us both sites of Lascaux were breath-taking.  Lascaux IV is about getting the facts and Lascaux II for us, was about getting the feeling and bringing it to life.Huge thank you for sharing such an amazing piece of pre-history with us.Read more

Comment: Most amazing experience.   Was sceptical about going to see this, as the cave art was not original, but this far outpassed my expectations.   Worth every Euro of the tour price. The guide provided a detailed and mostly audible account (the head sets didn’t work, and her soft French accent although charming, made it challenging at times). The museum portion contained the same information with further reproductions of the art work.  Wasn’t as impressed with the 3D movie. Bring a sweater it’s cool in the caves.Read more

Comment: This is a stunning modern building built into the hillside close to where cro-magnum art work was accidentally discovered in 1940.  The cave where the artwork was found is not accessible to the public but has been scrupulously recreated in an identical man made cave.  There are tours in English by docents who provide an entertaining perspective.  A very short movie takes place before the underground walk. It gets a little tight in the caves but the lighting is adequate and the footing is on level ground.  It is moderately strenuous and not for wheelchairs.Read more

Comment: One of the most fascinating places I've visited, although a replica of the original caves. It's up there with Pompeii and Herculaneum. My photos are from the exhibition area after you walk through a complete replica of the caves you aren't allowed to photograph inside the 'caves as it is too distracting for everyone Very sensible you need to follow the commentary. The temperature can be cool inside especially in summer so a cardigan/light jumper is useful, as are comfy footwear. You cannot go to see the original 20,000 year old paintings anymore as they were being damaged by moisture etc from visitors. The paintings are brought to life by amazing technology, the guided tour with individual headphones and tablets is brilliant. You are able to photograph 10 pictures which are emailed to you within a week all inclusive with entry. Give yourself plenty of time to see it all. There are lots of exhibits after the 'workshop area'. A packed lunch is a good idea the restaurant is pricey. Great gift shop but also I thought expensive.Read more

Comment: We came with mixed expectations knowing this was a replica cave. It was an exceptional experience. The staff at the centre were friendly and helpful. The guide Sam was knowledgeable and shared his interest with us very well. The technology that lies behind it all is amazing particularly in the workshop after the cave tour. We were very impressed and glad we had come. Read more

Comment: I was initially unenthusiastic about this reproduction of the original but I am so glad we persevered. especially after finding that you need to be well planned to join an 'English tour' at Lascaux 4 - which has been open for just two seasons. Make sure you book ahead, (on-line is possible), as there are limited English tours which will only get busier in future. Lascaux 4 is an excellent reproduction and was supported by an engaging and very well informed guide, reflecting not only on the art work but also their realism and otherwise, the techniques used and the potential meaning and societal context of the time.  The bluetooth audio technology is excellent and gives additional support for the second, self-guided half of the tour in the 'workshop' where you can take your time to explore a second set of reproductions. The parking was good, easy and free and the museum building itself was also impressive and functional. Like others, I had lowered my expectations before entering but found it better than I imagined and much more accessible - a great melding of authenticity and pragmatism for the visitor. This was one of the highlights of our tour of the region and is the best (and only) way to see those paintings in a context close to the original.  The guided tour is about one hour but you should allow at least 2 hours.  Don't miss this.Read more

Comment: I was aware this was a copy - and not even the first copy - of Lascaux, so I tried to lower my expectations before entering. In the end, I found it even better than I imagined!This is the only way to see those paintings in a setting close to the original. Also, we (people in general) hopefully don't want to see the original anyway, if it means it will decay even further.About the visit: I bought the ticket online, which saved a lot of time. The tour guide was very attentive and always made sure everyone could see the paintings she was talking about. The guided tour took about 1h and then we were free to see more details about the paintings and the cave in another room. This was also excelent.There was also a small movie (in 3 parts, each in a different room) about cave paintings, but the sound in french was superloud and the headset had to compete with it. At last there was a room with paintings and how some artists were inspired by cave paintings.You can't take pictures in the cave replica, but in the room with more replicas and informations you may.Make sure you also see paintings in original caves (like Rouffignac) to make the experience even more complete!Read more

Comment: We arrived on time with tickets that were purchased in advance. The English tour started exactly at 4:06. The guide was cool, we entered the cave, walked around, listened to the guide, then continued to the exposition where parts of the caves were on display and we could take pictures.All in all, good experience, but as you know, it's all fake. Reminded my of Disney Land.Paintings were great, and we were told that they are exact copy of the ones found in the original cave, but again, the paintings were only like 2 years old, versus the real paintings that were tens of thousands years old. We knew we were looking at a replica...So I wasn't too excited, especially for the price. Next time I will try to go to Gaume cave, although I heard it's hard to get in, unless you are in line by 7AM.Read more

Comment: Lascaux IX is now open. While  it is a reproduction, it is fantastic. I actually liked the reproduction more than some of the real caves because the lighting was better. Make sure you sign up for the English guided  tour. At the end of the tour, there is an area with duplicate reproductions that can be photographed, which I found to be particularly helpful. Four of us spent a month touring France, and this was one of the highlights. Read more

Comment: Book English slots as they are limited. The scale and quality of the cave is impressive, but not an entire replica as the chamber with painting depicting the bird man is only present in the interactive panels. Audio guide is easy to use, although unnecessarily over-complicated with so many functions. The crackling headsets became clearer on entering the replica cave. Guide is very knowledgeable explaining the context of the valley, people who lived there, areas of the replica cave system and replica cave art. Wear a fleece as the cave is cold. No photos allowed in the cave but opportunity to take photos in the interactive area where the art is displayed on panels. The 3D film is OK but  missed opportunity to explain more about the people. Although in French the headsets do explain in English. The whole experience takes around 3 hours. Building and setting have been designed to a high standard with masses of car parking.No dogs allowed so we booked one late morning slot and another mid afternoon to take it in turns whilst wandering in to town with our dog. My partner took the opportunity to walk to the entrance of the real cave over the hill.Read more

Comment: Firstly, book ahead- this means you'll be on a tour in the language you need and you'll be there at the time required and not need to wait around for ages.  Our tour was at 11:06 in English on Sunday 2nd September.  Our tour guide, Naomi, was knowledgeable and very friendly and we really enjoyed her commentary and how she answered questions at the end.  The headsets so you can hear wherever you are in the group are a great idea (assuming they work- I noticed at least 2 people in our group whose stopped working half way through).  We liked the new building too- it looks rather like a Bond villain's lair!- an image reinforced by the (friendly) security guy in black at the entrance door. The 'cave' is just brilliant- the reproductions of the paintings are astonishing and it even feels and smells cave-like (temperature wise its about 14 degrees, so it isn't freezing although a jumper is a good idea).  We liked the way the tour began with the boys who found the cave talking and the dog barking, while Naomi 'translated' for us.  It really is hard to remember you're not in a real cave and while there is that tiny sense of 'this isn't real' I think they have done an incredible job of bringing the next best thing to the general public.  After all, the real thing would be completely destroyed if we all marched in there! We spent a nice amount of time looking at the paintings in the various areas of the cave, although I think I could have stood and looked all day given the chance. After the cave was the museum section, which I have mixed feelings about.  The displays were very interactive, which was great, but required using the headset and screen we were given on arrival., All fine, except we had only been given very basic information about how the screens worked or what they could do- my husband and I realised almost at the end that our screen was capable of much more than we realised, and went back round to some exhibits to get the full experience (and neither of us are unaware about technology).  Some people were looking completely baffled.  There were staff around to ask, but as we didn't even realise the screen could do these things (such as you could scan an image and it would tell you bout it) we didn't know we were even missing anything.  The museum section is good, it just needs fine tuning. Finally there is a 'film' (which my machine refused to translate, so I missed most of it, although my husband said that it was rather strange anyway, and didn't give any new information) and a sort of animated 'play' about prehistoric paintings and when they were accepted as being real in Europe (which was good, but again, technology failed and my machine did it in the wrong order, so I got act 2 first, which was very confusing!) Overall we enjoyed it, we loved the cave and the paintings and felt we got a lot of information from our guide which informed our other cave visits later that week. However, the technology side does need some tweaking as it could be really useful and a wonderful way to access things and currently there isn't enough information given on how to use it, or the machines don't quite work at the right time.All the staff we encountered were lovely, especially our guide Naomi.Read more

Comment: With a number of venues and attractions offering cave paintings and tours, we chose to head for the most famous. Sadly, due to the guided tour element of the visit, you have to book in advance online to guarantee access. Prices are perfectly reasonable for the tour and access to facilities afterwards.The work that has gone into recreating the Lascaux caves is of such a high standard that I genuinely had to ask my partner if the whole thing had been man-made at one point.I'd advise taking along a sweater or jacket as it's around 15 degrees in the "caves" with 95% moisture.My only comments/criticisms of the venue are mainly based around the headsets; firstly they aren't very clear or loud, take some time to set up with no real explanation as to how to change the language and, most importantly, serve as a real distraction to young children for the first half of the tour. While in the caves, they aren't needed but try giving a kid a screen and telling them not to mess with it.  I spent some time having to convince my boy to put it down as nothing was on it, and listen to the guide. Once in the museum, it comes into its own, providing loads of info and interactive elements for adults and kids. It's just annoying to give it so early.Also, the cafe is extortionately expensive but thankfully there is a cafe just across the road near the car park that is cheaper.All in all, a great day out with a few slight glitches, results in a "very good".Read more

Comment: We booked onto a tour in English via the website a few days before our visit. Would recommend this as this enables you to avoid the long queue for tickets. The tour is in two parts, a guided talk through the replica of the caves and then you are able to explore the interactive areas with the tablet & headset provided. The whole experience was excellent. We had a really enthusiastic guide who explained the history behind the discovery of the cave and then the subsequent reasons behind why the replica was needed. The interactive area was very good, your ticket code determines the correct language and whether to load the Adult or child tablet software. My kids (6 & 9) loved wandering around the interactive area playing the games on the tablets. The tablet adjusts it's display as you walk around the exhibits. The augmented reality was really good. We also watched a 3D film, the main sound was in French but the words were also played out in English from the headsets via the tablets. We also thought the architecture of the building was amazing. Overall we were there for about 3 hours. Would recommend.Read more

Comment: Make sure you book tickets ahead, as tours in English are limited a full up quickly.The tour is inspiring and informative, you quickly forget you are in a replica cave due to the lighting and temperature - the cave art is wonderful. My daughter's could not believe how big and plentiful they were.The interactive gallery really added to the experience, as you could use them to listen to additional information, while looking at sections of the cave walls close up and in full lighting. I agree with other reviewers as I too would have liked to hear about the people who painted the caves and how they lived in more detail. The films afterwards weren't inspiring. I felt the 3D theatre could have been used to show us how the people lived in an immersive environment. I felt the film was a wasted opportunity and the seating in the theatre downright uncomfortable! I was trying to hold my neck up and had to sprawl on the seats in order to see the film. Overall a brilliant experience that surpassed my expectations.Read more

Comment: For 3 years we have now come to the Dordogne Perigord Noir. We are a family of 4 staying 32 miles away from the Lascaux site at Montignac.First thing to do: book online. It is almost impossible to get on the day tickets, to avoid disappointment book online before going. 2 x adults 1x disabled adult and 1 x child under 13 = €61. We booked for a Monday at 2:48pm, there was only 14 people on our tour. I will guess that week ends are a lot busier. Visits are only guided, you cannot visit by yourself. Visits are available in English, German and french of coure. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. The tour lasted an hour, thereafter you are free to roam the gallery, where you can once again experience the magic of the painting. Do take a jumper or jacket with you, the cave temperature is around 13C. You are furnished with a tablet, with which you follow the commentaries of the guide and more, take photos and send it to your own email. Bottom line a well worth visit. Know that the original caves have been shut since 1963, but these replicas are of the highest standards and the personnel on site very knowledgeable. We highly recommend, plan for a 2 hours visit.Read more

Comment: I had always wanted to see the cave art, but the original cave closed during the 1960's and the replica exhibition Lascaux 2 didn't inspire me to make the long trip there. Lascaux 4 however is an exact replica of the cave itself together with the art. The work and precision used to recreate this attraction is awesome. Each visitor received an electronic tour guide device complete with augmented reality screens. It is simply the best attraction experience I have ever been too. I thought that two 17 years olds would get bored, in the end after 4 hours it was me who waited for them! The whole site, restaurant and organisation is the best, it is truly an attraction France can be proud of and worth making a long detour to see it, don't forget to bring a jacket as the temperature inside is kept cool like the real cave!Read more

Comment: We visited as a family group of 2 parents, 2 adults in their 20’s and an 8 year old. The replica cave & paintings were really excellent. Our guide Hugo spoke fantastic English and was easy to hear and follow. His narrative was detailed and thought provoking.  The centre itself is impressive, clean, easy to park and all staff we met were very friendly. The cafe looked to be a nice quality.We were disappointed in the museum which was just more replica’s of the paintings and not much else. We felt there could have been more information about the cave painters, their daily life. Perhaps also more about cave painting in other parts of the world. We spent very little time in the museum.Also, the ‘cinema’ session at the start of the tour was disappointing. Fantastic room and technology but completely underwhelming film. Again, more about prehistoric man, where & how they lived, would have been interesting. Overall, not to be missed because of its historic importance, but some disappointing features of the experience.Read more

Comment: I last visited Lascaux in 1993 and at that time, it was the replica Lascaux II.  It was wonderful (literally wonder-filled).  Now the French have taken the experience to a whole new level with Lascaux IV - a replica of all the cave painting galleries, spectacularly reproduced using lasers, expert artist, and a marvelous interpretative center.  Be sure and sign up well before you come to the Dordogne for one of the English guided tour spots.  Set it up so you can have lunch in the cafe overlooking the lovely wildflower garden and enjoy the Snohetta designed museum that houses it all.  Do allow extra time to find the parking area near the museum.  We find many French attractions lack proper signing, so you may have to search a little for the parking area and you can always ask a local - "Ou est la Musée Lascaux, still vous plâit?"  The parking is right nearby and the locals are happy to help. And bring a jacket!  Lascaux IV replicates the temperature (in the 60s) of the real Lascaux, nearby.I also suggest pairing this visit with another day of visiting the excellent National Museum of Prehistory in nearby Les Eyzies.  If you have time, also schedule a visit inside one of the caves, itself.  I particularly recommend Font de Gaume.Read more

Comment: This was a real disappointment. The reproduction caves themselves form a small part of the tour. The guided tours are poorly spaced out so we spent a lot of time waiting for the previous group to move on whilst our guide tried to keep us occupied. The groups are so close together that it is difficult to hear the guide assigned to you over the noise. The second part of the tour involves moving through some exhibitions whilst listening to  a tour through a tablet. The tablets didn’t work properly and so we gave up on that part. We then visited the 3D cinema. My husband and children’s tablets worked fine to translate the film. Mine did not. They tell me it just repeated what the guide told us during the actual tour. Whilst the drawings are undoubtedly impressive I really would not recommend this trip. Read more

Comment: Booked online for the afternoon English tour - very well worthwhile as, besides the history of the finding of the paintings, we also learned about the techniques the artists used and had key elements pointed out and explained as went along.The reproductions seem excellent - the images are much larger than expected and the thought of how both the originals and the replicas were done was awe-inspiring.The exhibition that followed was excellent with commentary and images provided on a tablet with headphones. You can also use the tablet to take photos - well worth doing as they are set up for the low lighting. The photos will be emailed to you.Good shop with books and souvenirs - but no catering.Read more

Comment: Lascaux  IV is the place to visit which is the current version of the local cave art (there are previous versions which could be confusing) as this is the most interactive experience. I would recommend that you book in advance online for the English tour, otherwise you could be waiting around for some time and I probably wouldn't recommend this if you have children under 5 as it is a long tour that might not keep really young children amused. When you enter the reconstructed cave it is a little cooler and so you might want to take a jumper. The tour itself, which is of a reconstruction of the original cave was brilliant and our guide definitely knew her stuff and was able to answer any questions. The museum at the end was also a fascinating experience and fully interactive via personal tablets giving information in English. If you are in the area I would recommend a visit.Read more

Comment: The guide was really nice and knowledgeable however several things spoilt the visit:- all guided tours are tightly spaced out. So because of a family who arrived late and took their time to collect their audio gear. The rest of the group was waiting for them in the baking lift.- this delay led to the following group to catch up with us and because they were so loud, it was very hard to hear what our own guide was saying.- being in the peak of the summer, the group was at its maximum capacity, which means in narrow passages if you're not right next to the guide but at the other end, you have no idea what she's pointing at not can you hear.- the audio guide was very frustrating. It took me forever to realise how to use it. I missed out on most of the commentary. Plus it kept on rebooting and didn't recognize the numbers. Been told that was because we were too many.- the videos were also very frustrating. On the screen it said show starts in 2min so I tried to rush in but was stopped. They meant doors open in 2 mins!!! Grrrr!The whole visit was frustrating. And by the way you do not need to bring any warm clothes to visit. It was so hot outside that it was a nice change to be cool.Read more

Comment: The French do it best. To get it out of the way immediately, this is a replica cave, the real cave is closed to the public to protect it. Does it matter? Yes of course, a bit, but it depends how much you mind the Picasso on your wall being the real thing or a near perfect imitation. The 'cave' here looks and feels like the real thing, thanks to modern technology. And then following, there is some brilliant stuff showing most of the painting again in brighter light and with good explanations. You could spend a day here, learning about the art - and it is art - and much more. It's not over-expensive and the parking is free.Read more

Comment: When I was invited here I thought I might not enjoy the experience as it was a copy of the original. We met our guide and she brought us to site of original cave giving a very comprehensive narration of the discovery of the site. We then went to the cave and as a copy it is amazing. . The drawings are brilliant given they are around 17000 years old . The dimensions and lines are superb and it is astonishing how the ceilings could be painted in such detail in those primitive times .The children also loved the experienceRead more

Comment: We were in Lascaux caves yesterday and I admit, as someone who has done a thesis on indigenous cave art, I was apprehensive about not only looking at replica art but how they were going to make It interesting for children.Well I had nothing to be concerned about! My three boys aged 11 to 15 had a wonderful time due to the careful and thoughtful integration of modern technology into the informative scope of a museum visit. The guide explained very carefully and simply( in her second language) how to access the iPad and use it throughout the tour. She did not need to raise her voice because we could hear her through the headset which meant the cave tour was more magical and intimate as the guide from the French group ahead of us could not be heard.I over heard my youngest saying “the way these headphones work is amazing,”We had the topography of the area explained and were sent back in time to the ice-Age through her detailed commentary, and then forward again to 1940when the caves were discovered.With such a lead up, entering the caves was more realistic and magical than I expected. I wanted to ask about the efforts to replicate the images so well however I didn’t as I felt it would spoil the ‘reality’ of the experience for all. They have obviously spent a lot of money creating what is one of the best museums I have been to recently.The use of the iPads in the interactive museum that follows the cave reproduction is exceptional. You can get short video explanations of the artwork or the iPad displays the paintings you are standing near and explains the theories behind them in detail. We looked at replicas of the ochre, paintbrushes and deer fat lamps that were used to light the cave for drawing. All explained well with interactive boards where children could create their own artwork and explore information at their own pace.The parking was free and plenty of it too. An interesting and education experience for all which had us all discussing theories of cave art over breakfast this morning.Read more

Comment: Five stars are simply not enough for this immersive experience at the site of the Lascaux caves. I’d been to Lascaux 2 back in 2002 and even then I was impressed with the reconstruction effort - but 16 years on and a major capital investment since, the curators/architects have created in my view the greatest museum I’ve ever been to. What makes it so good? Well, firstly they’ve moved on from the slavish devotion most museums have to original object veneration and instead focussed on the visitor experience. Second, they’ve really though hard about the visitor journey and made learning simply awe inspiring, and fun. The innovative use of technology has been taken to its best here in the tablets and audio guide that rather than act as a barrier to the visit, really want to make you explore more.We took the English tour in the morning which first involves an explanation of the technology by a very charming and patient guide. Then you’re taken to a video area that is at first a window overlooking the landscape, then superimposed a video of how the terrain looked 17,000 years ago. Without adding too many spoilers the descent into the reconstructed cave to see the paintings is breathtaking and you quickly forget you’re not in the real thing. If you’re not blown away by the miracle of this cave’s discovery and the high level of sophistication of the paintings within, then life must be perpetually very disappointing for you.After the cave visit, the museum displays where they’ve separated each tranche of the cave paintings into reconstructions for closer examination are just brilliant. Here you can spend as long as you like using the handheld device to explore what we know and what we wonder about the main images in the cave.I can’t gush enough about this place. It is a must see place and will leave you in awe at the wonder of humanity. Hunter gatherer Michelangelos whose only signatures might be a set of multi-coloured rectangles. It makes you realise how trivial most of our day to day affairs are in comparison to the longevity of this masterwork and legacy to a culture long forgotten and never to be fully understood.The only downside for me was the film at the end which tried to be deep but ended up making me very sleepy.Read more

Comment: What a day.I thought I would have been underwhelmed having to make do with copies of the original art having been to see many genuine cave paintings and carvings already but surprisingly was not.They have put money into this centre and it shows, we went to "Le Thot" first - a short drive away to see the prehistoric animals on show and the visitor centre where we were able to buy a ticket for the tour here as well at the same time and were glad that we did as the combo turned out to be great value. A coffee and a short wait later saw us whisked back in time to the discovery of the cave, the cave itself - sublime and really very beautiful even though it is a replica.  After that, though it was closed, we briefly visited Lescaux 2 a short drive away and saw as close to the entrance of the original cave as was possible to get which was only about 800 metres away from that again. We understand that L2 is still open to the public for a more intimate visitor experience than the multi million pound museum but didn't get to enjoy that.Great value, convenient parking, facilities, café and fantastic gift shop, cinema and exhibitions made this a special day with the pretty town of Montignac nearby. What made the day special was the kids receiving a signed copy of the book "The Secret of the Forest Of Lescaux" from the writer and illustrator. On the way home after dinner when it was dark, the kids noticed two tiny fawns on the road as we passed by almost right under the cave itself which they found more impressive by than the thousands of years old art.Don't be put off by the artificial cave paintings.Read more

Comment: We were unsure about this, being a bit cautious about reconstructions. However, we need not have been concerned – Lascaux IV is a must if you are in the area. We were prompted to go by two kind Americans, who were staying in the same place as us. They had two spare tickets, and encouraged us to use them.The museum itself is worth seeing – so well and unobtrusively set into the hillside just a short distance from Montignac. The design reminded us of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. Inside it’s all very high tech, and offers a dramatic access to the reconstructed cave paintings, the originals  dating back as far as 17,000 years ago. This is as close as you’ll get into the minds of Chro-Magnon man, given that there is to no access to the original Lascaux and Lascaux II.The tour (preceded by some contextual scene setting) of the reconstructed cave, with all the famous paintings carefully replicated. is clear and well presented, and conducted in reasonably small groups. There is plenty of opportunity to question the guide, who was more than knowledgeable enough to keep us engaged.From there you are free to explore the rest of the Centre for as long as you like, armed with interactive iPad. Be sure not to miss the 3D cinema presentation, which acts as a stunning accompaniment to the whole experience.Critics of this place are being churlish - I'd be surprised if anybody was fooled into thinking the paintings are originals - the Centre certainly does not seek to make you think this. And, given that you can't see any of this art at first hand, and the commercial side of the centre is not over-emphasised, I'd strongly recommend visiting the Centre.Read more

Comment: Lascaux is one of those sites that I had always hoped I would be able to visit - even as a replica cave, and for me Lascaux IV didn't disappoint.Lascaux IV is an exceptionally well thought out visitor experience that caters for all ages. I am sure that even those visitors who are not especially interested in prehistory, can appreciate the effort and attention to detail that has gone into creating such an excellent visitor experience.The young lady who was our guide for part of the English tour was helpful and enthusiastic, and ensured that our group had a well informed tour - even when an individual in our group seemed intent on challenging much of the information she was presenting. Well done to that particular Lascaux guide.Read more

Comment: Went on an English language tour of the reproduced cave system, one of he party was in a wheelchair, there was no issue in this only that the reproduced cave system follows the cave floor and slants downward all the time, they give you a tablet and earphones to follow the tour and point out all the different animals, there are exhibitions and cinema experiences included after the tour, we also had a decent lunch on the terrace afterwards, this was easier than finding paring somewhere else.Read more

Comment: Somewhat hesitant, we chose to go to Lascaux IV, a reproduction of 2 galleries of the Lascaux caves in Montinaq.  It turned out to be an amazing experience!  The caves are meticulously recreated using computer scanning.  The exhibit is kept at 13 C with 90 % humidity, which is the same as in the actual cave.  Our guide, Cecile, was excellent.  She is very knowledgeable about both the cave and the art within.  The artwork is simply stunning.  The tour lasts about 50 minutes and then you are on your own to explore the exhibits you saw in the cave in a museum.  Through a tablet, you get further placating of the art.  What I really liked was that the engravings which Cecile did a great job of highlighting with a laser pointer came alive separate from the art they accompany.  It made it clear how masterful these artists were, 20,000 years ago! Overall, a fubulous experience!Read more

Comment: The cave art is beautiful, and the history lesson is nice. The child Information is not good for ten year olds, maybe for seven or five year olds, but it had vague information. The worst part is the guide, he talked too much in the cave so we could not really concentrate and really enjoy the paintings.Other than that, the restaraunt was not great. Certainly a once in a lifetime experience, but not the most enjoyable.Read more

Comment: This is an efficient and well designed representation and experience of the cave art of Lascaux.  We booked an English tour several weeks before arriving in France.  I highly recommend doing this.  You must print out your tickets in advance on white paper and bring them to the site or have the email confirmation of that on your phone. You start with a guided tour during which time you learn about the setting and history of the early people living here and also about the people who discovered the cave.  The Museum site is brand new and is situated into the hills.  It has a terrific new interactive area with ipads that further explain details of painting replicas where you can take photos on the ipad that get uploaded into email accounts.  (That's why they want your email address when you sign up for tickets.) You may also use cameras or phones in this area.  There is a gift shop and a nice cafe on site.  Plenty of parking is available.  One note, if you need to use the toilets in the parking area, make sure you have tissues with you as "No loo paper is provided."  Very strange! You would have to go back to the museum to get a proper toilet facility if you find yourself not prepared with Kleenex tissue.Read more

Comment: So the original caves were discovered in 1940 after being hidden for nearly 17,000 years. The story behind this is really interesting but due to the change in the interior climate with visitors, it was closed in the 1970 and Lascaux II was built.  This new (old) reproduction was ok, but did not fill the wishes of the curators.  So the new Lascaux International Center for Cave Art was built.  Todays, experience is truly wonderful.  There are tours offered in several languages.  The tour begins with a theatre experience to demonstrate the area 17,000 years ago.  Then on to the entrance of the reproduction.  Our guide was really very competent, and able to answer every question.  The quality of the reproduction of the cave is amazing, the colors the vividness of the art, etc. make this very worth while.  There are no PHOTOS allowed on this portion of the tour,  Not so much as damage to the art, but to keep the group together.  There is a group about every 10 minutes and I can see someone getting lost from their group.  After the caves are the workshop area ( photos allowed, you are on your own, and then two movie presentations about the original cave and the building of this facility.  We enjoyed the book store and the Cafe Lascaux outside on the terrace was really nice with good food.  Our only mistake, this was VACATION week for the kids from school so while our tour group was all adults, once outside there was a few hundred kids running around.Read more

Comment: In this remarkable recreation of the Caves at Lascaux, we experienced and appreciated the craft of the artists and engineers who brought this opportunity to life.  We reserved our English tour well in advance.  Even in April, the museum was very busy.  An English speaking guide took us through the reproduction of the caves, which led to "the workshops" where we could listen on provided headphones to in depth information about the history and science behind this discovery and its reproduction.  One should allow at least three hours for the entire experience.Read more

Comment: We are glad we added a visit to the Lascaux International Centre for Cave Art into our trip itinerary. What a unique experience! I want to take a minute to thank the staff. We had arrived too late for the scheduled "English Speaking" tour. However, they worked with their tour guides and found a volunteer willing to take us last minute (6 people). Our guide (Oriane) was outstanding. Summoning her best English, Oriane patiently walked us through the historic details of the cave and prehistoric art. I am claustrophobic but never expected the faux cave to make me feel uncomfortable. Wrong! They did such a great job replicating the "real cave" that I ended up getting very uncomfortable. Good News, Oriane helped me through it by reminding me and showing me the exit doors within close proximity. She also used light and distracted me with so much interesting facts that I finally felt fine, relaxed and enjoyed the experience. Thank You Oriane. Thank You Lascaux staff for a unique and memorable visit.Read more

Comment: Was a bit apprehensive about visiting as their website could be better and was worried about the reproduction of the cave. Our tour was great, the reproduction was really interesting and overall the visit was very good. Left (as they said) with more questions than answers, but blown away by the beauty of the cave paintings and the sense of the space. Great modern building - hope it lasts 25,000 years! Read more

Comment: It is hard living here, as there are so many places to visit. Some like  Lascaux 4 are WORLD famous. I have always wanted to visit, and being winter we thought it would be quiet and a nice day out. We were told the English tour would start at 11:06 and it did with about 10 people not all English. We were met and welcomed by a pleasant man who told us what would happen and how we would have a tablet and earphones for use in the Area's e.g. French people could have that language while on the English tour. and then introduced us to our English speaking guide Camile who gave us more information before escorting us into the very spacious entrance.There are a number of sections, all were very informative and well presented.I would have had the full 3D film show first and then done the walk through the cave, the guide was very good answered questions took her time did not rush people. The quality and detail of the paintings done 20,000 years ago was incredible.We then went into the 'Workshop' which is technically very good although you sometimes have to prompt the 'Tablet' to sync with the illustrations. The tablet also can be used to take your own photos of the DETAIL in the workshop, and with your email address those photos would be sent to you the next day. You could spend a long time in the workshop area, it is fascinating.We left there and found (Not well signed) a small area with VAR goggles and a joystick where you feel fully immersed in the 'CAVE' experience, you move your head and the image moves you feel as if you are there. you can retrieve objects I found three, so must have missed some I think.As we left we had hoped to have lunch in the restaurant on site but because our tour took as long as it did we were too late and the restaurant was full anyway. We were given directions to a good restaurant near the river in the town.We would recommend everyone visiting or living in the area to visit, it is not cheap but it is VERY well done.Read more

Comment: A brilliant reproduction of the actual cave. The original cave and paintings are faithfully replicated in detail that goes beyond what you can see. Then when you have seen the replica the key paintings are replicated again in the departure room with a laser light show to bring out the layers of the paintings. It’s as close to the real thing you can get without destroying the original.All visitors must join a tour, and their are some foreign language tours so it is worth checking when they are available, however if you have to hear the French commentary iPads are provided to assist you. Exceptionally worthwhile whatever language you hear. Allow at least 3 hours if you can. This facility has only been open since Dec 2016 and will become extremely popular.Read more

Comment: My son and I went to see Lascaux IV, the recently open Lascaux reproduction of the entire orignal cave. In order to prepare the visit, I called ahead and talked to their info desk. The person was extremely friendly and helpful. The Lascaux website is very confusing and it doesn't tell you the times for the English visits. I am used to waiting in France, but not this time. The winter season is great to see the Dordogne area as there are few tourists. Unfortunately, few places are open. Lascaux was quiet. Our 4:06 pm visit was right on time. Our guide Gwen (??) was very knowledgeable and his English excellent.  My only problem was that the visit went too fast for me to look at details and admire or absorb the load of information. I managed to ask lots of questions and got answers for all of them. The "tablet" you receive at the beginning of the visit is the best ever. You can personalise it and you can even send the photos you took to your email address !!! It  even turns into a flashlight. My son loved the interactivity,  Very impressive piece of technology!The visit is in 4 parts: the outdoor explanation, the underground or the cave, the grand hall with interactive features and finally, the movie theater. The shop has a nice range of items. The restaurant was clean and food was fine. The whole experience was extremely positive. We learnt a lot. The reproductions are simply amazing. The modern artists used the same techniques as the cavemen 20 to 25000 years ago. But most of all, I couldn't believe that men, so "prehistorical", could be such great artists and could master Art so well with so little. What happened to men during the Medieval ages? we went backwards. Sad. This place is a must and I encourage people to visit it like the hundred of thousands who came in 2017.Read more

Comment: If you like human history (prehistory, actually) you will love this site. Even if you are not big into history, this site will probably amaze you. I am an archaeologist but I never did get to visit Lascaux original (1) before it was closed to the public. I did visit Lascaux 2 in 2002 and I was impressed with its precision. L-3 is a traveling exhibit. Now L-4, which is better than 2 because it replicates more of the cave, and its associated museum/exhibit room. You are not deceived into thinking your are really in the cave (the flat floor and the lighting give it away), but the experience is striking, nonetheless. And the museum hall with replicas of wall segments, where you can take photos, is a terrific addition from L 2.  For a real cave art experience, go to Pech Merle in the Cahors area; but the cave art is not nearly as spectacular. Absolutely worth a visit. Tours only, and reservations usually needed. Be sure to get an English tour if you don't speak French.Read more

Comment: Having a house in the area I had visited Lascaux II in the past and had seen the huge building project of Lascaux IV taking shape not far away. Lascaux II is tucked away in the woods and has a rather attractive home spun feeling both in its ticket office, little gift shop and in the way the tour of the small facsimile of the original cave is conducted. No interactive technology provided here to help visitors understand the fabulous cave art, just a torch and an enthusiastic guide. I can understand why some visitors prefer the unusual 'down the rabbit hole' experience of Lascaux II as I recall emerging into the dappled warmth of the sun in the midst of woods after the tour of the world of prehistoric cave art.But with family visiting we set off for the new International Centre for Cave Art not far away. We were six, three adults and three teenagers. The latter did not qualify for a child or student entry rate and there was no discounted rate for me as a senior citizen. The entry tariff was therefore 'hefty'. But bearing in mind the exceptional quality of the interactive exhibits of Lascaux IV I believe that it offered very good value of money.The building housing the new larger cave facsimile, spacious exhibition spaces, airy entrance waiting areas, gift shop and cafe is breathtaking and the view from it's 'walk up' sloping roof over the lovely village of Monignac wonderful. The meticulously copied cave interior filled with a riot of marvelously exciting cave paintings is just as atmospheric as Lascaux II and more extensive. The story of how the original cave was found was done well and the guide helped one see and start to understand the myriad of animal paintings on the walls. We think that it would make sense if the tablet and headphones we were all given at the start of the tour of the cave area actually provided the commentary in different languages for those unable to access one of the twice daily english language tours. French language tours are very frequent throughout the day but the number of english language tours are much more limited and often get booked up online days ahead. But the interactive tablet came into its own during the exhibitions following the cave tour. The teenagers with us were immediately proficient in exploring the symbolism of the various paintings using their tablets provided with an english translation and interactive tools. They particularly loved the electronic cave painting exhibit, and the wall demonstrating how the cave painters depicted the movement of the animals they hunted. There were plenty of helpers around to sort out any glitches in the technology and all spoke english. The theatre in three acts telling one about the history of research into cave art was very well done too and the tablet gave a full translation. The cinema too kept interest and was unexpected. We had already spent three hours on the tour when we came to the exhibition focusing on the links between the work of contemporary artists and cave artists. We put together our own selection of art from the displays available, found out who the artists were, discussed the links with the cave paintings we had seen and were able to read about it all before our exhibition selection filled the wall and ceiling of this big dark space. We all loved it.Finally we visited the very extensive gift shop to purchase books and do-it-yourself cave painting kits to take home and enjoyed a drink in the sun (in early November!!) outside the very pleasant cafe / bistrot.All in all a thought provoking and very enjoyable afternoon. One not to be missed by anyone visiting this most beautiful part of south west France in our view.Read more

Comment: The Lascaux visit was a little confusing - do you go to Lascaux ll or lV, and if there’s a ll and lV, where’s lll?  And would the whole experience be cheesy, visiting a fake cave. Looking on line prior to our visit wasn’t all that helpful either. We went to lV  mainly because we came upon it first when driving there, but it ended up to be the right option. Lascaux lV is the fairly new museum which includes the most comprehensive reproduction of the cave.  They provided a very good tour in English with good multi-media information. We were pleasantly surprised and thought the whole experience was well done. We were lucky enough to arrive at a time when there was an English tour coming up, otherwise we’d have been out of luck as you must be on a tour.  When you go they’ll offer for you to buy a combined ticket for two other locations - Thot and Grand Roc/Laugerie Basse; we didn’t go to Grand Roc but did go to the other two locations which we found to be disappointing.

Comment: There are currently 4 Lascaux. The original was closed in 1963 due to deterioration caused by the many tourists (primarily the affects of their breathing). Lascaux 2 was created as a 'copy' of the original & was thought by many to be a better experience than the original. Lascaux 3 is a touring version of the caves & paintings & is currently in China. With Lascaux 2 showing signs of wear & deterioration Lascaux 4 was built & opened in December 2016 but Lascaux 2 is still open to the public. There are various thoughts on which is the best but to my mind Lascaux 4 has more going for it.We booked tickets through Semitour.com which give a range of options. In our instance we picked to go to 3 separate attractions (over 2 days), 1 of which was Lascaux 4, for a total cost of 23 Euros per person. A fair saving on paying individually. Regrettably you need to be able to read French to navigate the site, but if you can, its well worth a look.You have a choice of start times for the tour. They seem to start every 15 minutes - but the majority are in French - so if you don't speak French its clearly important to pick an English language tour.There is a large well lit waiting area, with shop, toilets etc, until your 'tour' is called. Then a guided tour, taking you up in a large lift, a distribution of headphones & tablets, and an overall summary of the time, the area & the finding of the cave.At this stage you are outside, & all the building work is modern concrete but as soon as you enter 'the cave' the outside structure is forgotten.Our guide spoke good English & seemed very knowledgeable. The cave sides & roof are said to be exact replicas of the original as are the paintings. I lost track of time but I think the 'guided' part of the tour lasted about 40 minutes. Photography at this stage is forbidden but there are opportunities later.After the cave tour, the guide leaves you to your own devices (though there are lots of staff on hand if you have specific questions) you are initially into a large hall which houses many audio visual devices and a lot of large fibreglass mouldings representing different parts of the cave, made to look exactly like that part of the cave & with all the 'original' paintings on them - and it is here that you can photograph.After that there are several 'cinema' type presentations showing the history of Lascaux & putting it into some context & then youre back into the entry/waiting area. The open audio is in French but you still have tablet & headphones & these translate to your chosen language.Theres no rush in these latter areas, take as much time as you need.Overall we found it a wonderful experience, lasting for us about 3 hours.Read more

Comment: Having visited Lascaux 2 three years ago and seen the ground work taking place for Lascaux 4, we couldn't wait for it to open. So in August we returned. Our first impression was good. The new center has been brilliantly designed and blends into the surrounding countryside very well. Car parking was also very good. The booking system was good and the waiting area comfortable.We managed to get in on one of the English speaking tours, which is essential unless you speak good French. However I am afraid that I was rather underwhelmed by what we came to see. Having been blown away by the brilliance of the atmospheric Lascaux 2 three years ago we found this experience to be lacking any atmosphere. In 2 you feel as though you are entering a real cave, whereas here its a bit walking round the back of a shopping precinct and going into a lift!I can understand why visitors who have not experienced 2 think that 4 is wonderful. Yes it is good, but there is possibly too much information to take in with what you see and what is shown and told on your tablet (provided free ).It I had to recommend either 2 or 4, I would say visit 2 and then pop down the road to go to the shop and excellent cafe at the new 4 center.Read more

Comment: This is a replica of cave drawings from 20,000 years ago. Firstly the building housing the cave replicas is a gorgeous ultra modern structure nestled into the hill side. Our guide was delightful and knowledgeable. She was enthusiastic and inspired by the art. A new cave was added in December. The paintings are fascinating. At the beginning of the tour there is a simulation of the landscape and animals from the caveman years. This was very well done and provides an added perspective of those ancient times. This is modern France at its best!Read more

Comment: We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and can't understand some of the negative comments about it being a reproduction but treated as the real thing ! You can't mistake that this is a stunning modern building when you arrive.It is made clear that the cave system has been re created by using 3d mapping to recreate the caves as close as possible whilst still giving access to walk through. Except for the temperature not being as cold as an original cave the experience was very realistic and the studio room with exhibits of the parts that weren't accessible as too narrow for humans to get through was excellent.We actually thought that the headsets were great and meant that you could clearly hear the guide wherever you were in the group, though a couple did have a problem with their tablets.The only comment would be that the groups were maybe a little large and I agree with another reviewer that they were quite close together which did occasionally cause a bottle neck. Overall we were really impressed and would visit again. Good value as wellRead more

Comment: There are many good things to say about visiting the new Lascaux centre. It's an amazing building nestling in to the hillside and the replica cave and paintings have been faithfully done, all very impressive indeed. However, the unnecessary tablet and headphones are infuriating and some in our group couldn't get theirs to work. The lighting in the 'caves' is bland and makes for a rather anodyne experience. Tour groups ahead and behind you are so close they can bottle-neck, which again detracts from the event. Despite the lavish buildings and extra galleries, I would seriously think about going to the old Lascaux 2 where it is done better.Read more

Comment: I knew going in that we would not be seeing the actual wall paintings -- and I appreciate the need to protect these incredible pieces of ancient pre-history. However, the current exhibit is a reproduction that gets treated like it's the real thing. I get that you want people to have an authentic experience, but it isn't. I think they should admit that. The tour technology is mediocre. The guide is hard to hear because the headphones have so much feedback. The "interactive" display later has a somewhat cumbersome interface. I guess this is a must-see, just because it tells us something about human beings so very long ago, but meh.Read more

Comment: When in the area, you need to go to Lascaux IV. We went in September and there was lots of free parking and it wasn't that busy. English speaking guide and we were given headphones to hear better. However, being partially deaf, I struggled to hear her. This didn't detract too much from the experience however as a trip through the 'cave' was really interesting. Afterwards you can walk round at your leisure, using the headphones and tablets that explain it all again. There's also a virtual 3D journey through the 'cave' (which made me feel a bit sick) and a theatre production.Well worth the €16 entrance feeRead more

Comment: The lascaux caves are really confusing when booking and I didn't really know what to expect... we booked an English tour on line and had no trouble finding our guide and getting tablet guides working. The new building and repro caves are great and the guided tour is good. The right level of detail for us. The interactive exhibits and exhibition are a great way to study in more detail and to take photo. Taking into account the huge number of visitors wanting to see these paintings and the issues with the real caves then this is a thoughtful and modern way to present the story of the cave paintings to as many people as possible. Don't be but off by these being reproductions and not in a real cave, we enjoyed the experience and had little of the technology problems that others talk about. But do book in advance on line if visiting in peak times!Read more

Comment: We were looking forward to seeing this newly opened (Dec 2016) replica of the original cave closed since 1964. The building on the outskirts of Montignac was interesting. I appreciated how it was sort of inserted into the hill next to the original cave, so it would not command the whole view. Plenty of parking right outside the building.The replica did give you the feel of the original cave (except for the groups of tourists in it), well done. Seeing the reproduction paintings of the famous bulls and horses is definitely still an experience.Our guide was very knowledgable (we decided to take the French tour, since our command of French is adequate, and we had had another tour - this time in English - somewhere else in France where the guide had a very heavy French accent and was hard to understand).We combined this visit with a visit to the Musee de la Préhistoire in Les Eyzies.Read more

Comment: An odd but excellent combination of imposing modern visitor centre and 20,000 yr old prehistoric cave/paintings replica.  Only so much it can do given it is not the real thing (which is closed to the public), but it does what it can very well.A few tips and pointers:- book in advance!  It opens until very late in the day and at peak times it may well be sold out that day if you turn up and hope to visit.  And even if not, a long queue or wait may await- visits are all on guided tours for the first 45 mins or so, which take you through the replica caves and paintings they have created deep in the centre.   Tours def available in English (and obviously French) and possibly other languages too.  You will be given an exact time when you book.  Be ready at least 5 mins before and allow another 15 mins to Q to clear security, etc.- tour guide stops at various points to relay the story of the cave's discovery in the 1940s and then to point out featured in the caves themselves.  We had a great guide, Charlotte, with impeccable English (through a nice French accent) enthusiasm and knowledge.- The cave part is a really impressive replica - thousands of overlapping paintings and engravings and even wall shapes copied exactly from the originals.  Impressive depictions of horses, deer, bulls and more in combinations of black and red and yellow It's quite awe inspiring and you lose yourself in it.  It lacks the mustiness and smells and tight squeezes of a real cave but is still atmospheric.  - it's quite cool in there (13 degrees C) but pleasant.  Floor is even so accessible for all.  Babies and toddlers admitted and safe - main risk is drowning out the guide and atmosphere if noisy.- for whole tour and after you are given a tablet and headphones.  You can listen through the tour guide with those - but I found better not to for most of the tour.  They are more useful in the workshop part that follows.- the workshop is a big hall area with more replicas of some of the cave paintings, but with more info and photos allowed.  I sometimes find these areas a bit dull, but this is really well done.  And when you walk up to an exhibit, your tablet downloads info on it, and you can get a short voiced summary about it by pressing the headphones button on your tablet - after that there are also cinema and theatre areas, a gift shop, and (rather pricey) cafe- quite pricey; 44 euro for a family ticket and about 16 for adults and 10 for younger kids.  Slight discounts for students etc.- masses of car parking in big car parks about 5 mins walk away halfway between the town and Lascaux.  But if you're in Montignac its nicer and easier to walk there instead.  About 15 mins (less than 1km) and take Rue de Barry which is near tourist info and cinema paradiso.  - easy to get the various Lascaux centres mixed up.  This is Lascaux 4 (IV) which opened in 2016.  Also known as 'centre international de l'art parietal.  It is an advance on the nearby Lascaux II, which is a little further away from town, is still open, and does the same sort of thing in a more detailed but less technically advanced way.  Lascaux III is a mobile exhibit that tours the world and Lascaux I is the original I guess - which is very close to II and IV but not open to the public.Read more

Comment: Last went here 25 years ago when it was Lascaux 2 , we paid for our tickets at a kiosk then and were given a tour in the the Lascaux copy , everything has changed Lots of parking spaces , a big new visitor centre , there was line to buy tickets but it was France's official holiday season and busy  , becouse we needed an English speaking tour we got in pretty quickly The tour was informative then we were then taken to an interactive area with mini I-pad type devices with headphones which recognised which point of the room we were at and gave information , children had devices with puzzles to do , excellent ! , there were two cinemas with 3D glasses provided and to end it all a cafe and gift shop , toilets are in the building although sign posts directed us across the car park which had no toilet tissue ?? Best to go inside The whole experience was great a good day out and the price was very good value , highly recommend the attractionRead more

Comment: This is how a modern museum should be done. You get a tour of the impressive replica cave with an informative guide, then a great interactive 'workshop'.  The videos are also great. We had children of 6 and 8 with us and they were absorbed by the whole experience. Read more

Comment: We really enjoyed our visit to the Lascaux centre. Having not been organised enough to book months in advance (or realistically getting there early enough to get tickets on the day)  to see any of the real caves in the valley, I expected this one to be clearly second choice and feel like a fake. But it is incredibly impressive. The extensive use of technology to aid interpretation worked for us: we had a few minor glitches, but overall it really enhanced the experience and was particularly good for our younger son.  I can see how it would irritate some people though.Read more

Comment: Seeing quite a few mixed reviews on Lascaux we were a bit apprehensive. But as it turns out we really enjoyed the visit. Our guide Joseph was great and their approach to explaining the whole thing was very good. They give you a tablet and earphones and with them you can really get a lot of interesting additional details after you visit the casting of the cave. This is especially good for kids as it allows them to approach history in an interactive and game-like approach. Personally I found it confusing that Lascaux IV is called Lascaux Centre International de l'Art Parietal, especially since Lascaux II is now closed. I know it is a big centre but not immediately clear what it contains. The online reservation system is not great, that's the only reason why my review only got 4 stars (actually, I would highly welcome if the rating system on tripadvisor were a bit more granular as I often hesitate to give 5, which I think should be reserved for a 100% flawless experience. I see too many people giving 5s because they feel 4 is not good enough...but that way the distinction between excellent and just good is extremely difficult to make... enough of a rant). If you want to visit the Grottes de Lascaux, make sure that you either buy the tickets at least 48 hours in advance on their Internet site or that you are at the visitors center before the opening at 8.30 am on the day of your visit to reserve your space/tickets. The site doesn't tell you anywhere that it doesn't accept reservations less than 2 days in advance (actually I remember seeing a place where it said J+1, which was clearly misleading). I reserved the day before, my payment was accepted (got confirmation on screen) but when we came "home" from our outings in the evening I discovered that we had not received the tickets. Checking back at the site in my folder, I was "told" that there was a problem, the tickets were not issued. I then had to go on line the next morning. Not cool. Read more

Comment: I had so looked forward to visiting the Lascaux cave (I was well aware that the original is closed and its a replica that you see) but was left feeling slightly disappointed by the whole experience. We had booked an English tour in advance but our guide was actually Swedish with a very strong accent so it was difficult to understand a lot of what she said. Also the headsets were very temperamental and a lot of people gave up on them. The actual tour through the cave is very short although interesting to see. I would have liked information on how they actually made the replica and how does anyone know it is an exact replica. After seeing the cave art you then go into a gallery area and use a tablet to interact with the exhibits, again these were very temperamental and older people really had no idea what to do with them and spent most of their time having to find guides to try and explain what they were supposed to do with them. Once you got the hand of them they were ok. After this there is a short 3D film which was very blurry and quite boring and then a part called the Gallery of Imagination which was completely pointless, you just swipe images around on a big screen to make your own collage up. We then went into a room where they had virtual reality headsets that enable you to take your own trip around the cave and that was superb, definitely the best bit.Overall I think they've tried to make it all very modern and hi-tech but a lot of the equipment just wasn't up to scratch and left most people confused and frustrated. For me the whole experience was a bit like The Emperors Clothes, made out to be utterly amazing but in reality it just didn't match up.Read more

Comment: We met Ben our Tour Guide at the Place Pasteur bus stop which was a short walk from our Best Western Hotel Le Renoir. Ben was our driver and tour guide. Our first stop Les Eyzies de Tayac for a guided visit of the National Prehistory Museum. Ben provided a very important and quick trip through the museum and artefacts which was essential to understand the region and the people who lived there. Our second stop was a visit of the amazing Rouffignac Cave which has original and authentic etchings and drawings. An electric powered train takes you through the cave to see the cave art. What a unique experience and not to be missed.We stopped in St. Léon for lunch and were able to walk around and explore the scenic village by the river.Our last stop was Montignac where the Lascaux IV cave replica was opened in late 2016 and is a perfect reproduction of the original cave. Our guide through the Lascaux IV cave reproduction took us back in time to the young men who found the cave and gave us insight into the people who roamed the area and created their glorious art in the original Lascaux cave. Merci Beaucoup Ben!Read more

Comment: Lascaux cave is one of the most important finds in Europe however it is not possible for the public to visit because our presence deteriorates the quality of the beautiful 20,000 year paintings. So first a reproduction called Lascaux II was created but it is above the original cave and it was found that the traffic and human footfall was affecting the cave underneath. Lascaux IV has been created (Lascaux III is a mobile recreation which tours the world). This is a marvel of modern human endeavour. The original paintings are important because of their number, size and use of three colours (very few cave art uses red, black and yellow). Because the cave was effectively sealed off for millennia the quality of the paintings were in excellent condition. OK it is not the real thing but as we aren't going to be able to see that, then it is a privelege to be able to see these pictures reproduced in a facsimile of the actual cave. I have visited a number of the caves in the area and the paintings in them are not to the extent and quality of Lascaux. Try not to turn up your noses to this reproduction - it is stunning and brilliantly done so we are able to see what this very important discovery of pre-history looks like. The guided tour lasts about 1 hour and our guide had very good English. The interactive gallery after the tour is tremendous for both adults and children. I was very impressed with the whole experience.Read more

Comment: Prior to going to Lascaux, we had been to a couple of original caves in the area - Grottes de Font de Gaume and Grotte Rouffignac.Although both of those are, in all probability, smaller and less impressive than the original Lascaux, you cannot get away from the fact that what you can now see at Lascaux is a copy.  And, frankly, the copy is very impressive.But it is not original and that, for us at least, is what made the difference between a good experience and a great one.  I have no doubt whatsoever that if one could see the original Lascaux then one would be totally blown away.  But it is artificial.  What you see is said to be an absolute copy.  But how does one know?  And the part of the tour which takes you through this copy of the cave lasts only about 30 minutes.  Then there are a lot of add ons - cinema, exhibitions etc which really did not interest us.So the earlier visits to alternatives put this into perspective for us.Hence my title.  I kinda of liked it but it was not as good as the original caves/drawings in the area.As part of the writing of this review, I have seen one from last year about Lascaux 2 - we were at Lascaux 4 - and we now wonder if Lascaux 2 is still open?  There are no signs for it.Read more

Comment: Someone clearly took a lot of money in his hands to build such an impressive exhibition center. The premises boosts a modern architecture and provides convenient parking. The replica of the Lascaux cave is well done as well.However we were terriblly disappointed by the German guided tour which offered very little insights. The worst part were those iPads. The majority of our tour could not make them work, the menu to operate them is way too complex and information is not provided in an adequate manner, ie in way too small pieces; everything is overly complicated. Has that system and the way it tries to convey knowledge ever been  tested for user-friendliness? Also those two movies did not manage to convey any consistent story. What a disappointment - even more so as an experienced knowledge management expert could turn this mess around easily within a week.Read more

Comment: The new reproduction of the Lascaux cave is an extraordinary experience. Much praise should be directed to those who have executed this project. The art represented here marks the first steps that mankind took to become truly human. It is humbling and exhilarating to experience it. That having been said, this experience is not for everyone. This is not Disneyland or a trivial entertainment. Those who do not take the time ahead of their visit to read about the remarkable history of the Dordogne cave paintings and contemplate what this means might be well advised to spend their day doing something else.Read more

Comment: Lascaux 1 = original cave, discovered in 1940, closed in 1963. Over 600 parietal wall paintings of large animals, the paintings are estimated around 17,000 years BP. Lascaux 2 = copy of the Lascaux cave opened for public in 1983, Lascaux 3 = tour "Lascaux, the International Exhibition" since 2012, Lascaux 4 = Lascaux International Center with a copy of Lascaux cave opened for public in 2016I never visited Lascaux 2 so I can not make a comparison. Lascaux 2 is still open to the public but it now has only French speaking tours. Lascaux 2 tour costs 13 €, Lascaux 4 tour costs 16 €. If you plan to spend all day in Montignac, it is worth considering buying a joint ticket for Lascaux 4+Parc du Thot for 20€. Make sure you book your visit at least 1 day in advance. The center is open 365 days a year, bravo!The building itself is very modern with lots of concrete and it needs time for the new plants to grow and cheer it up a bit. We visited in April 2017. Our guide was professional, kind and his English was comprehensible. I would prefer the bigger time space between groups as we could hear both groups before and after us. The tablet and headphones are not working if you are too far from the guide. The cave is very detailed and well made so you nearly forget that it is „only“ a replica. The paintings themselves are amazing.After the cave tour you then you go through the big room where you can take photos of the parts of paintings. The tablet is activated when you get close to each painting and it gives you more interesting information.3D films are in French, headsets should activate and translate in English, but mine and several others did not work. There are other interesting workshops, especially for kids.I would like to visit again in few years time, hoping that they will have changed/improved the contents of the 3D films, including the one at the beginning of the tour.So it is definitely worth the visit! You need to book in advance to get the English tour. You cannot book on-line for a visit on the same day. The guided tour is only 45 minutes but the whole visit takes at least 2 hours – I recommend comfortable shoes. Make sure that your tablet works correctly and that it is set on the language of your choice before you start the visit.Read more

Comment: The new Lascaux International Centre for Cave Art (“Lascaux IV”) was inaugurated in December, 2016 in a large, modern complex (looks like an airport terminal) in Montignac.  To clear the confusion upfront : this is an independent new site, separate from Lascaux II (the replica cave at the original site, which operates limited English tours – none in May, one daily in Jun-Aug it appears, so it’s clear they are redirecting bulk tourist traffic here).   We did not pre-book (May isn’t terribly busy) but arrived in time for the 11.06 am English tour (there are only 2 English tours a day, check schedules!) and bought tickets at 16€ each. Our guide met us and handed out iPad-type tablets with headphones for use later.  We were given some background of the cave and its discovery, as we walked past panels that try to recreate the cave’s story and original environs, until we entered a dark room containing the actual reproduction of the cave (the whole cave, as opposed to Lascaux 2 which covers a reduced area). It is a very impressive effort, and it’s invaluable to have the guide point out the detail you’re bound to miss and run over the outlines with a laser pointer pen, to truly appreciate the art. After the cave, you enter a museum-like area (where you start to use the tablet, which uses wifi/location mapping to flash information and commentary for the exhibits as you approach them. Many of the cave’s major sections are represented here as panels: “Two Crossed Bison”, “The Apse”, “The Axial Gallery”, “The Hall of the Bulls” etc. etc. (you can take photos here, but not previously in the cave) . There were a number of other experiences after including a 3D film theatre, an "imagination" gallery where you could swipe different prices of art on a large screen and create your own collage and an interesting virtual reality experience where you navigate yourself around the simulated cave.  So there’s a lot of technology at work here (apart from the $70mn spent to build it), clearly elevating the ticket price (makes it more expensive than the Louvre!)Read more

Comment: Amazing, fascinating, interesting, informative and thrilling. A marvellous reconstruction of the original 17000 year old site which should charm even the most ardent critics. Of course it's not the original but there are very good justifications for it not being so. Go along and live through and feel as well as see the experience. Do take a warm jumper or similar it's pretty cool down below ground. Tasty though rather expensive lunch was good too!Read more

Comment: I believe this is a "can't miss" if you are anywhere near the location. It is a reproduction, because the original caves are closed for good reason. However, learning about the technology used is an interesting as learning about the paintings themselves. The museum after the cave walk is equally amazing, plus, while you cannot take photos in the cave, you may take as many a you like in the museum. This site is the main reason we visited this part of France, and we were not disappointed. We also toured the remaining open cave with paintings at Niaux. Paired together, and unforgettable experience. Worth going out of the way if you can manage it.Read more

Comment: This is a wonderful outing. Along with the rest of our six-member group, we were shown various sites that feature exhibits all having to do with ancient history of the region. Most notable were the Musee National de Prehistoire, the Rouffignac caves, and finally, the recently completed Lascaux IV exhibit. The real highlight, however, was our guide: Marion is awfully knowledgeable, very kind, and inordinately patient. The meeting point for the tour (an all-day affair) is a central spot in the town of Sarlat--very easy to locate, and an easy walk within much of the town. If you have any interest at all in prehistoric cave art, this is a trip you won't want to miss.Read more

Comment: Having visited Lascaux 2 on previous occasions and really enjoyed it, we visited Lascaux 4 and it is a travesty.A hideous concrete bunker greets the visitor and this does not augur well.The whole thing is like Disneyland, technology for technologies sake, meaningless and unworkable, even to the teenage school group behind us. Tours are very crowded, 50 odd people, at intervals of 5 minutes. We had Italian ahead, Spanish behind and we were trying to listen and learn and admire in English.Nothing worked, even scanning our entry ticket failed. A waste of 16 euros for us but how much more to the French people as well as the EU.There is no resemblance to a cave, a facsimile of what? Even the plaster is peeling from the ceiling and it only opened in late 2016.Vast spaces outside with nothing but an odd video.Don't waste your money.Read more

Comment: This was the most incredible trip. I was quite apprehensive about the paintings being a reproduction of the original caves (which have been shut since 1963 to protect them) but they have done a totally brilliant job in replicating the art and the atmosphere so that we were swept up in the visit and 'believed' we were seeing the real thing.  Only opened December 16, we felt really lucky to be able to visit. I think you can only book the day before (I did it online) and you need to be really quick to get the tickets for the English tour option.  The paintings are spectacular and are huge... I really had no idea of the scale. There was good information from our guide on technique and materials, backed up by the headset which really came into its own after the cave part.  The visitor centre / 'workshop' that follows the cave visit is engrossing and we enjoyed the technology interface. A beautifully designed building (no information on the architect displayed which was disappointing).  Can take 10 minutes to walk from car park b so leave enough time if you don't want to arrive hot and flustered like us!  Tours leave every few minutes so you need to arrive promptly.  All in all this was the highlight of our 10 day tour of France and a cultural feast... fantastic.Read more

Comment: Much money was spent on attempting to give visitors an experience of the amazing prehistoric art of the original Lascaux cave. Nice try. But while there are still real caves to visit I prefer them to walking around an artificial, interactive series of installations pushing buttons, watching projections and listening to an auditory guide on headphones.Read more

Comment: As you can imagine this world-famous site has a huge number of visitors but the organization of this place is so well done that it still feels quite a personal experience. The real cave has been so well reproduced that you feel you are in the real thing. There are so many famous pictures to see with the expert guide explaining their form and significance. The galleries after the cave are state-of-the-art using personal tablets with headphones that enable you to discover as much or as little as you want about Lascaux. The Café is, as you would expect in such a high-profile site in France, well worth eating at. You can book English tours but need to do so on line otherwise you may have to wait.Read more

Comment: The new centre only opened in December 2016 and this is evidenced by the busy gardeners trying to get the expansive grassed areas growing. The centre itself is stunning both from the outside and inside where it is a wonder of impressive technology. We prebooked an English tour and met Camille at precisely 11.06 and she then showed us how to use the brilliant little interactive handsets that once your entry ticket was scanned in using the barcode the machine knew everything about you - well nationality at least! It is interesting to note that German speakers are not catered for at the moment, only English, Spanish and of course, French. We first rode up to the top of the building in a large glass lift where the view from the top is stunning and then we were given a short history of the caves' discovery in 1940 by boys chasing their dog in the woods and all of a sudden, we heard a dog barking just ahead of us. It set the scene nicely. Inside the cave after a safety warning we entered and it was very dark but you could still see around you and walked down a long passage with beautiful drawings on the walls and ceilings. The most impressive was the Bulls Hall with the animals painted in wonderful colours. After the tour of the caves we came out into the main hall where various images of the different areas were shown in greater detail and the little handset came to life to be very interactive and this is where you are allowed to talk photographs. The cross sections built from fibre glass and steel were hung from the ceiling. This in itself was impressive and your time was your own in here so you could spend as little or as much time as you wished. My husband and I were in there for ages. There is also a theatre with a three act play of the story and a cinema but we did not watch this. The gift shop is well stocked and not overly expensive and there is something for every taste. I bought a magnet. We did not try the cafe but we did climb the steps on the outside of the building to spend more time on the roof that is planted with wild flowers. The building almost disappears into the side of the mountain and is wonderful to look at. The architects must surely win awards for the innovative design. There is plenty of car parking but not many rubbish bins in the car park. A fabulous visit.Read more

Comment: Sadly, it would appear that a unique and astounding treasure of humanity has been turned into a tourist trap. The technical feat of reproducing the caves painted twenty thousand years ago by our ancestors is immense, and it is a unique pleasure to be able to experience the mysterious work of early man. Last week I visited Lascaux IV, which opened in December 2016. I've been to the Lascaux II site many times over the years. Though conditions there were more rustic and access far more awkward, visitors were more appreciative and seemingly more motivated to learn about early man. The building looks very impressive, super modern and immense. There are good rest rooms, a very nice shop. There’s a highly regimented visit of the cave replica offered, you have to reserve in advance for an English tour, as before. You start by getting headsets and a tablet to hang around your neck, then you go on the rooftop when the leader explains about the terrain and points out where the original cave is but nobody listens to him. It being France, the tour guide’s microphone, ostensibly tuned into our headsets, didn’t work, quelle surprise. People at the back of the group yak among themselves, the little kids fidget and squeal. Once inside the building again there’s a short film about the likely surroundings and the prehistoric animals (limited seating, most people stood). Then as a group you go into the cave copy, much like Lascaux II. Flooring and light levels are also like Lascaux II. People with canes or unsure walkers will want a little flashlight, tho I don’t actually know if it’s permitted. We did see a few people in wheelchairs visiting. The cave area copied has a couple more spaces than at Lascaux II, so that was great to see – the apse in particular, where the pit is down below with the famous stick figure drawing and bird. (Tho you don’t see the pit, just that there’s a hole.) Biggest problem along the way is hearing/understanding what the guide has to say. Tho we were on the English tour, of course it’s a French person leading so a lot of words were mangled, some beyond recognition. He continually pronounced “cow” as “co” as in co-worker; he mis-translated “pinceau” as “pencil”, whereas a pinceau is a paintbrush. And so on. The man was knowledgeable, patient and friendly…just hard to hear and even when you could hear, hard to understand. He gave much more info than in previous tours at Lascaux II about the cave and the people who made the paintings, I did enjoy that aspect a lot. Participants yak among themselves despite repeated shushing, and there are other small groups ahead and behind. I heard three separate people in my group ask if they were seeing the original cave or a copy, they had no idea. It’s basically the Lascaux ride at France-land. Respect and awe level: close to zero. After the cave, there’s a short informative chat to follow up on a few points, and then people are free to wander around a large room with pieces of the cave wall copies, so you can better understand how the copies were made, as well as get more info about the original cave and conditions at that time. It’s like a big showroom/museum and there is some welcome seating. The tablet is a bit of a challenge, with indecipherable icons, but if you spend some time to try to get it going, there are short videos on a dozen or so topics that were excellent. There’s also a 3D film (in French, headsets did not transmit in English as promised) in a separate theatre-type room which was a 100% waste of time (wtf are these people thinking?) and by then I was so fed up with the sheer ineptitude of it all I didn’t even go into another room. That said, with some background being given in advance, I think people who have some actual interest in prehistory will enjoy the facsimile, and -- if the communication technology is improved -- the very fine explanations. At least 90 minutes are needed, we were there 2 hours and did not dally.Read more

Comment: I never had a chance to see the original cave or Lascaux II, but Lascaux IV is extremely well done and I don't feel I have missed out on the experience. We had an excellent, enthusiastic guide in English, who toured us through the recreated cave, pointing out all the marvelous details created by our near ancestors. What a unique glimpse into their insight, inspirations and ideas. My 9 yr old son enjoyed the interactive workshops area as well. Wonderful and well worth the visit. I especially appreciated the art gallery portion where the centre links how the cave art has inspired modern artists. I know previous reviewers have mentioned disorganization or sub-par tours, but I think these are growing pains, and by April 2017, the bugs are being worked out by staff.Read more

Comment: The center is very interesting and exposes you well to the prehistoric art. Worth the visit. That said, it is a shame that they cram groups into the cave and create "traffic jams". Spacing out the groups would only do justice to the visitors and the experience. Also, it would have been great if English language instruction would have been more readily available. Oh well, it is France after all...Read more

Comment: The French are getting better and better at these cave facsimiles given that there are so many problems keeping the originals open to the public but having said that,there is still a bit of work to do here if it is to become a truly international attraction with better information available to non French speakers !I have spent a lot of time in prehistoric caves over a great many years and would expect a facility like this to be set up in several languages for the casual visitor...on the day of our visit there was just 1 afternoon tour offered in English and it was difficult to find any guide notes and general information provided in English or indeed any other major European language...thought that was very odd !However, the visit is a worthwhile experience and the whole afternoon spent here seeing the copies plus all the other exhibits costing your entrance fee of 16 euros is certainly good value for money.If you are an English speaker and need to know more about what you are going to be seeing, I recommend reading up on the history of Lascaux and its fabulous paintings before you make the journey here !Read more

Comment: Lascaux IV, Centre International de l’Art Pariétal, opened its gates December 2016. We had a chance to visit and were positively surprised. Having visited the Lascaux II cave a few years back, and most of the accessible caves in the region, we were at first somewhat skeptical about the reports of all the technology involved.The original cave was closed to the public in 1963, and only now becomes accessible in full again.  The design of the center is well thought through and brings the visitor first to the replica of the cave, like the Lascaux II done meticulously, but adding the original entrance, and a much better feeling for the lay-out. No photography is allowed here, which helps you concentrate on the guide, and undisturbed by the flashes of others.After this tour, which took about one hour, you enter the ‘atelier’, were large sections of the walls are exhibited (again). Through the clever use of projections, engravings and earlier layers as well as spacial relations are made visible. Other parts allow exploration using black light, some of the exhibits lower parts of the ceiling which would have been inaccessible in the cave. Photography is allowed here, and every visitor is handed a ‘tablet’ that will supply you with geo-referenced information. We spend 2 hours here, and could have stayed longer…After these main exhibition spaces there is a small 3D movie theater and three rooms with projections  to introduce some of the history, developments and background to the knowledge and research of pre-historic art. A small surprise was the ‘galerie’  that linked modern artists and pre-historic art.Read more

Comment: We've been in Lascaux 2 in 2014 and were amazed by the copy of the paintings so we were impatient to visit Lascaux 4 and all the additional material they would offer (then it was under construction). We finally went there 1 month after the opening but the experience, for now, is very disappointing and in a way irritating.1/ Lascaux 2 museum was modest, built on the hill, in the forest and the building and the location itself were a first eficient and intime introduction to the cave. Lascaux 4 is a huge piece of concret (floor, wall, ceiling), cold, where you first have to stand in a huge hall (or seat on cubes) and wait to be called, and parked in front of a line like a scholar or a sheep. 15 mn between each group. A screen show the time departure of each group, like in an airport. 2/ Lascaux 4 presents itself like an interactive museum, so actually the first step of the visit is to switch on a device you hang around your neck and activate it with a QR code. You stand once again, now in a small room. Staff distribute the devices and is not really helpfull with the elderly.3/ The visit begins on the roof of the building. You have first to climb long stairs - not very easy for old people or young children. Then you stand on the roof, outside  where the guide makes a presentation of the history of the area and the cavemen. Probably interesting in the summer, but in January in a chilly and rainy day with nothing to protect you from the wind and the rain, not exactly. Here the interactive device just adds on the camera screen the location of the other caves - wher a simple map on a panoramic table would be enough. What's the meaning of such presentation? Is it essential to stand outside in the cold on the top of the roof for that ? Maybe they simply wanted us to experience for a moment the harsh life ot the cavemen? 4/ Then you go through opened concrete corridors with huge walls (6 meters high and more) until the entrance of a first room (each time you have to open big metallic doors and keep them open for the other people - it actually reminded me walking through the corridors of the basemend of my building to the trash room - same corridors, same door...). Here they show you a ridiculous cheap 3D animation of the landscape 20 000 years ago. Basically you see a tiger with a big squint trying to catch an antilope - in slow motion. Then a short video of the teenagers who discovered the cave (10 seconds). 5/ New exterior corridor with speakers playing the sound of a barking dog. New trash room door. Now you stand for 5 min in a dark room - to be prepared to the cave. Actually it's just because the previous group is still in the cave. 6/ Finally the cave. This part is trully amazing of course. But here again your group is between 2 other groups, so when your guide is a shy youg girl who whispers akward English (mine is bad too, of course so I'm not a guide, and for foreigner visitors it's not professional) and when the two other guides are South-West barytons, you don't hear the right guide and it's not exactly as quiet as you could expect. But it's not really disturbing for you actually just have 20 minutes to watch everything before they push you out from the cave.7/ After the cave the guide let you in big room with many interactive modules. This part is interesting but here again your device is not really usefull.Don't get me wrong : I leave in Lascaux area and I really like the cave paintings and the copy, so I was the first one to wait for the opening and bring my parents there but most of the additional values promissed in Lascaux 4 are just useless show-off.  So : +The copy of the cave is amazingThe guide was kindSome modules of the last room are interesting-The building is pretentious and coldThe visit path is unlogical and unnessecarily unconfortable (stairs, roof, doors, weather) The guide was not skilled The interactive device is just a big joke - though it has a real potential3D don't make a video intersting just because it's 3D - though it has a real potentialSpeakers don't create a mood by repeating 10 times the same sounds. - though it has a real potential.20 mn in the cave is too short. Though of course it has a real potential.So unless Lascaux 4 decides to really use all the potential of the new technologies they proudly promote and redesign the visit (like many good new museums in Europe) I would rather recommend to go to Lascaux 2Read more
