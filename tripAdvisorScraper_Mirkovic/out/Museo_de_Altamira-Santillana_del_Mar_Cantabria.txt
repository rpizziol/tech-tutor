Comment: The Spanish tourism website indicated (for days) that tickets were available through Bank Santander (NO THEY ARE NOT - either online, BS website, branches, ATMs or at the BS headquarters) or at Cave museum.Well, we were among dozens of very UNHAPPY travelers that found out (after days of waiting and hours of driving) that tickets are not available unless purchased weeks in advance.If you know exactly which day/time frame you'll want to visit the museum they don't bother showing up.We spoke to may locals, hotel manager, and tourists who had the same unfortunate experience.Read more

Comment: It is a real art history demonstration! I was impressed by wonderful drawing techniques used in order to reveal shadows, shapes and to create illusions. It is impressive to see drawings of thousand years old, real art of our ancestors.Read more

Comment: Besides the actual museum, which is interesting enough in itself, Altamira offers a reproduction of the real cave, which currently can only be visited by 5 people a week for preservation reasons. But the reproduction offers a very realistic experience because it is the same size as the real one, with a lot of added information.Visits to the cave are for a limited number of people even if it’s a reproduction, and the tickets are timed for that reason. If you skip the cue as some do, and enter the museum, you will only see the museum, and miss the opportunity to see the cave, which is the unique experience offered by this museum.At the busiest times of year there is a line at the ticket office, but one can also buy the ticket on line. Tickets sold on line, however, are for guided tours.If you do not speak Spanish, the best option is to download the official museum app, which is free and works exactly as an audiogiude (and using ear or head phones is also advisable, as one should be quiet in the cave).Read more

Comment: Arrived at opening hour. Long queues one member of staff. Some in queue tour guides so multiple tickets being printed off. One person pushed in and was served. Half an hour wait to get a ticket with a Timed entry 20 minutes on. This turns out to be the chance to enter another queuing area. 10 minutes late we are admitted to the exhibition.  Such frustrations do not enhance the visitor experience. They could be avoided with decent organisation. I would have been happy to pay a bigger entrance fee to get a better experience. I would advise visitor to skip Altamira until they can organise it properly and visit the amazing museum of human evolution in Burgos insteadRead more

Comment: Having been bowled over by Lascaux in France, we were expecting something along the same lines.  Yes - good parking and layout in the museum but very little of any substance apart from the dominating display of Spanish stamps with pictures of cave art on them.  The staff were not the most friendly, unlike Lascaux. You get the idea that they are local government employees rather than folk smitten with the ancient history bug.  They have done a good job in recreating the original cave but, to be blunt, it is nowhere near as impressive or huge as Lascaux. The shop was quite good with a variety of goods for all ages and all price brackets and we were amazed that OAPs get in free. So, go if you are in the area on a wet day but don't bother to drive miles for this experience.Read more

Comment: This is a very popular museum based on the caves where the prehistoric wall paintings were found.  To ensure the real wall paintings were not damaged a reproduction was constructed called the neocave so that visitors could get a good idea of what the original cave looked like. Entry to this is by a timed ticket. There are queues to get into the musuem and car parking at the site is good.  The main museum has some interesting displays but a slightly muddled approach.  The neocave is well worth a visit, and is proud of its excellent access for disabled visitorsRead more

Comment: This is a very popular attraction but with a little bit of forward planning you can make your life easier.  You can visit the museum part for free.  This will give you access to the story of the Altamira cave and the cave art, as well as exhibits of finds from the caves in the area.  The information boards are in Spanish and English. The actual cave can no longer be visited (except for a few randomly chosen people each Friday).  There is, however, a superbly executed faithful replica of the cave which can be visited with a guide.  This visit, which is extremely popular, cost €3 each, which is definitely a bargain!  In order to avoid enormous queues and long waiting times, you can book this ahead and choose a time slot.  This is free and you pay for your tickets online. At busy times, however, you may need to do this 2-3 days ahead of your visit.  Once you have booked this, you will be given a booking reference number.  Go straight into the main museum and give this number in at the information / reception desk.  They will then give you your tickets and your exact time slot for visiting the replica cave.  These visits take place every 5 minutes, are guided (in Spanish) and allow around 20 people in at a time.The replica cave itself is of incredible quality and if no-one told you, you wouldn't realise that you weren't in a real cave at all.  You are allowed to take photos in there.  The guided tour of the cave is in Spanish, but there are some information boards in there which are also in English.The whole experience offers excellent value for money, but can get very busy.  To avoid parking issues, try going first thing in the morning or in the 1.30-3.30pm lunchtime slot.Read more

Comment: While I understand the need for the replica Neocave at Altamira, the visitor experience is far less interesting than visiting the real cave paintings at Cueva Covalanas.  While the Cueva Covalanas paintings are not as elaborate as the ones at Altamira, experiencing the cave as the real Paleolithic artists did 22,000 years ago makes a world of difference. Also the tour guides at Cueva Covalanas are wonderfully enthusiastic.Read more

Comment: First visited this amazing cave in the late 1970's and had always hoped for a return visit. Although we were not winners in the Friday am Altamira Draw, and were not part of the group of 5 visitors to experience the real cave, we nevertheless had an excellent day.I can understand the disappointment some visitors may feel in being unable to tour the actual cave, but appreciate that the Neocave is the best solution that can be provided for the numbers of tourists who want to visit this fascinating site. For me the Neocave was a far better experience than I had expected. I thought the museum exhibits were outstanding, and if you have an interest in Palaeolithic art, anthropology and or archaeology - then you will probably want to spend a few hours in the museum.I would certainly visit Altamira again and see it as a superb visitor attraction for all ages.Read more

Comment: May 4 at 2:33 PMWe were driving from Ribadesella to Bilbao and had to stop and see this Unesco site.  The popularity was so dramatic that they had to close the caves because of the erosion and damage from so many visitors.  They created a replica of the main cavern that contains the amazing drawings to allow the public to experience the early artistry of these people.  The museum grounds are pastoral and you can walk to see the original cave entrance.  We were there on a Sunday and admission was free.Read more

Comment: So, we humans breathe too much.  We ruin the caves with our numbers and humidity and such. They have created a wonderful, lovable replica and lots of interpretation about the culture and archaeology. Lovely museum, being enjoyed by all sorts of tourists and school kids. They have done an excellent  job of showing what life was like thousands of years ago in that area.  We walked up to the cave entrance, which, of course, is not the same as it was in ancient times.  Well done, even though our shear numbers prevent us from the direct experience in the caves.  I do not resent this.  It has to be so to protect the resource.  Read more

Comment: Once you deal with the fact that you cannot see the real deal (and that is so we can protect this treasure for the future geneteations), the experience is excellent with the neocave giving a superb replica of the cave and displaying the incredible paintings of our ancient predecessors. The museum attached is good also to explain the background to the paleolithic art. We reserved our tickets which is a must do and we just collected from the main desk with no delay. Worth trying to experience an authentic cave also if you can. Great value to visit any of these incredible places. 4 out of 5 because it is not the real cave.Read more

Comment: Although a lot of money has been invested in the museum and the “Neocave”, the latter falls short of reproducing the all-important ambience of cave art – the darkness and the typically demanding access, not to mention the associated dripping stalactites – without which you might as well look at good quality photographs.  The rest of museum displays are well designed and provide a good background to Palaeolithic life for all ages and interest levels.But 95 km and about an hour’s drive to the west along the coast is the much less well-known Centro de Arte Rupestre de Tito Bustillo, an easy walk from the centre of Ribedesella, which also has a very well-designed museum but most importantly offers guided tours for small groups to see actual cave art in situ.  For us, there was simply no comparison – although be prepared for a fairly long dimly lit walk underground.Read more

Comment: Another must-see destination if you travel to the north of Spain.  This museum and reproduction of the cave is truly amazing.  Visitors are not allowed in the original cave due to potential damage.  The reproduction is unbelievably realistic, you totally forget it's not the real thing.  The paintings on the roof of this cave should be seen by everyone.  Being approx. 15,000 years old it's hard to imagine the skill needed to recreate the animals.  It's a magical experience.Read more

Comment: A museum with the history of the area and the people and how the cave was discovered--plus timed guided tours through the "new cave" a mock up of the real cave, rightly now closed to the public to preserve it. The paintings are well recreated--and you can take photos. The guided tour was good (though we were given a time for one in English--then it was in Spanish). But it is like being in a museum not a cave--good for posterity, but hard not to feel the loss of being in the cool dark and seeing the drawings above you.Read more

Comment: Before my visit I was surprised that the "cave" would be open to visitors - but when I visited I realised that the museum was a reproduction of the cave!! But, no complaints because it is extremely well done - you feel as it you are walking through the real cave and the pictures from ancient times are, I think, faithfully reproduced - and they are fascinating to see and experience.Thankfully there is information in English, although not enough but this did not spoil our visit.A beautiful and unique experience, although perhaps a bit boring for children, would interest nearly any adult.A must-see place.Read more

Comment: The caves of Altamira have been closed to the public since the great amount of visitors caused deterioration of the drawings.Now you can see replicas of the drawings.The museo de Altamira shows very good replicas of the drawings in a great setting. You almost think you are in a real cave! The 3D projection at the start gives a nice idea of how the people in the caves might have lived.A very interesting experience!Read more

Comment: My husband and I (we are Americans) visited the museum on July 7th, 2017 and had a very unpleasant experience.  The museum is really a children's exhibit.  It contains almost nothing of the recent breakthroughs in archeological discoveries or recently discovered history.  The tour of the "man made" caves was given by a woman who whispered so could not be heard and all in Spanish so any person who didn't speak Spanish was completely lost.  She did not allow me to translate for my husband and when I asked her to speak up so we could all hear, she yelled at me.I would skip this stop unless you have young children who speak Spanish.Read more

Comment: I had been excited to see the caves. It was a real bucket of cold water to discover we were only allowed to see a replica.  I totally understand the reason behind it. However, the replica is not impressive, as it's not the real thing. The exhibits were a bit boring to my 17 year old, and the others in our group dismissed the experience altogether as being a waste of time.Read more

Comment: When I heard that the cave was a replica and not the real cave, I wasn't concerned. However The cave experience was nothing like being in a real cave, unless a cave is air-conditioned and climate controlled with lights everywhere.  The experience is challenging for English speakers. There was no guided tour in English available.  They rushed us through the tour in 30 minutes, with another tour group hot on our tail.  The acoustics made it hard to hear.  The museum however was excellent. It had English translations and facilitated learning with some hands-on displays, and really good videos showing prehistoric life.Read more

Comment: This renowned museum offers with its Neocave an exact copy of the original Altamira cave, discovered in 1868. It took until 1902 to have the scientific community to accept the fact that this Cave Art, mainly consisting of European Bisons, was made by man in the late Pleistocene, about 15.000 years ago. The museum is well designed, has great portable artefacts on display and very informative imagery and sign boards. The only slight disadvantage is the many hundreds of schoolkids running around the place. Education is great but so is a little discipline.Read more

Comment: The cave became known prehistoric paintings on the walls and discovered by a hunter's daughter in 1868. It can be reached on foot in Santillana del Mar, it is a pleasant walk 2 kilometers during which you can admire nature. The cave is a delight by figures painted prehistoric cave. But ... you must kow: you will see a "reproduction" of the original cave, you can visit with or without guide, it is spectacular and you shudder when you think that has existed for over 30 000 years.Read more

Comment: The Altamira Museum is a short drive from the town of Santillana Del Mar.  The museum contains a replica of cave drawing and an extensive prehistory museum.  The cave drawings are interesting in that they show how the artists from 16,000 years ago used natural pigments and the shapes of rock outcroppings and cracks in the caves as part of their paintings.  Definitely worth seeing and it beats crawling on your knees though narrow spaces in nearby caves in order to see the real thing.  But faux is faux and we understand the need to preserve the real Altamira paintings.  Read more

Comment: The museum's theme is not about authenticity, but offering essential information about this remarkable early human artistic production to the general public (at 3 Euros a ticket). The replica of cave's ceiling is showing a number of graphic works which appeared to me less vivid than images found on the internet. Surprisingly, the floor of the cave space, although smooth and finished, has a 3 degree slope which adds a bit of disorientation to the strangeness of the place (actual reason not found). Before and after the cave's location, you are presented with information offered through projections, live displays, artifacts, and descriptive text (although not much in English). The staff at the gift shop told me that no book in their store shows pictures from the original cave, which would have given a chance for reference and comparison. Still, if you are in this region, visiting the museum is a good way to understand the original creation.Read more

Comment: Our visit to Altamira was truly memorable for two main reasons - firstly, the quality and value of the 12 euro Menu Del Dia meal we had in the cafe/restaurant - absolutely delicious - it was home cooking at its very finest and, I would hazard a guess, is a bit of an undiscovered treasure. Lentils, pasta and fried chicken with sauces that you'd travel a long way to taste. Secondly, the replica caves themselves. My wife is from Seville and she'd always wanted to visit. No they are not the real caves but yes they give a truly authentic feel, and the art on the ceilings is, quite frankly, staggering..... I can only speak Spanish to a level just above GCSE and I could follow most of what the guide was saying. Don't be put off by the lack of English tours - give this a go - it is truly a mind-broadening and great experience..Read more

Comment: Having seen the original cave paintings in 1960, which was a truly thrilling experience, I must say that the present museum, with reproductions, is no more than an interesting way to spend a rainy afternoon. But the public is no longer allowed to visit the originals, as variations in humidity and temperature caused by visitors can damage the incredible prehistoric murals. Crowded in season, you must book ahead.Read more

Comment: When you get here you are assigned a time when you actually get to go into the "cave". We had about an hour before we could actually go in but it was just enough time to look at the wealth of information on display outside of the "cave" entrance. Once inside we felt like we were in an actual cave even though we knew it was not the real thing. There was some signage and lights so it was pretty obvious but it was an excellent reproduction.Read more

Comment: This museum is situated just outside Santillana Del Mar about 2km.It was a wet day so we decided to visit the museum.We arrived early on the Sunday morning; queued for our tickets and was pleased to see it was free. Not sure if this was usual for Sundays or not.You are given a time slot for the main cave painting tour when you arrive.In the mean time you can look around the normal museum which has an excellent selection of artefacts. Sadly all of the information boards are in Spanish and no other languages.We finally go through to the caves; there is a short movie about when the cave paintings were found and we move on. A short walk later we arrive in the main chamber; it well laid out and it leads you down the large cave to the lower end where the paintings are on the roof.This is where we sadly realise the paintings that we are all looking at are replicas that have been placed authentically in the cave. Apparently the original ones are too delicate for close human attention.It would have been good to at least see the original ones through a window or something.The café and shop are very good with the food and drink very reasonable.Great visit but just slightly disappointing.I would still recommend a visit if you're in the area.Read more

Comment: I have read some negative spoiler comments about the museum and reproduction cave, but honestly what do people expect, for the whole cave to be destroyed by too many visitors and no doubt graffitied by idiots.  This is an excellent museum and the reproduction Neocuerva is fantastic.  There is an very good video showing how the reproduction was made.  Lots of exhibits in the museum as well which are genuine and lots of explanations of Paleolithic man's life.  The English explanations are easy to read in spite of what a lot of TA reviewers say.  And are as comprehensive as the Spanish one's.  Easy to find and a good carpark.  Free entry after 2pm on Saturdays and free anytime for seniors.  Quite a wonderful experience, I had no idea how large the actual paintings were.Read more

Comment: Not knowing I wouldn't be seeing the 'real thing' I too was disappointed at first. However having driven there we decided to go in anyway as the 3euro admission was cheap enough. I'm so glad I did and, having discovered how this important site had previously been overrun with visitors, I appreciate why the cave is now virtually closed to the public and a replica is offered in its place. But what a well done replica. As many interpretive displays are in Spain, this one is presented with sensitivity and insight. If you aren't interested in human prehistory, give it a miss. If you are you could spend hours and feel as I did that the admission charge is a paltry sum to pay for such a rich experience.Read more

Comment: This could be the museum that helps people of different nationalities to understand better, the ways the surrounding local caves have been understood and what they represent. However, I did not think they tried very hard to accommodate other cultures and the stories were a bit too basic. We arrived late (6.15pm) and the person who took our money was unhelpful about how long the exhibition would take, but told us we would catch the last showing (at 6.30pm) of the simulated cave (the original is closed for preservation at present) but in reality, they had shown it at some time before 6.25pm, so in fact, we missed it as we arrived at 6.25pm. In fact, if we had wanted to take more time over the exhibition we would have needed more than 3/4hr. It seemed to me to be better to read up about it and go to the other caves, but this was just our experience. However, it is not expensive so little was lost in having a look.Read more

Comment: An incredible learning experience that takes one back thousands of years and helps everyone to learn how the caves at Altamira, which is only a couple of minutes drive from the town of Santillana del Mar have provided invaluable information about the people that lived there thousands of years ago! The original caves cannot be visited because they have been closed to the general public due to the negative impact by thousands of visitors. Only five are allowed to visit when the drawings are done. Besides those, the only visitors allowed are heads of State that visit the sight.Read more

Comment: I was very excited to visit the re-construction of this cave. They have done a fantastic job of re-creating the real cave here. They have faithfully copied the art and environment in order to allow the visitor to experience the beauty of the monument. I hope that everyone understands what a delicate balance there is between appreciating the discovery of this treasure and preserving the original enviromnent. I really think they have done the very best thing to allow visitors to understand the cave paintings etc, and keep the original works protected from the damages of mass tourism. If you take the time to pay attention to the muesum part you can learn how and why the scientists re-created the cave for the visitors. Such attention to detail makes this a true wonder. Well done!Read more

Comment: At this facility you are unable to visit the actual Altamira cave discovered in 1879 and inhabited by humans as long as 35,000 years ago who created wonderful cave paintings, because the cave is now closed to tourists in order to help protect and preserve this treasure of Paleolithic art.  But, you can experience the next best thing -- the Neocave which is a replica of the actual cave that is located nearby.  In addition to the Neocave there is a wonderful museum with exhibits illustrating the breadth and depth of human evolution.  The exhibits and informative signage in this museum were excellent.  I spent 2 hours here and could easily have spent more time had I not been heading to Bilbao airport to catch a flight.Read more

Comment: The whole museum is very interesting and the replica cave is a work of art in itself. However, having visited Lascaux in France where not only is the cave replicated, but the "cave experience" too, I was rather disappointed. Nevertheless, everything is very well presented and educational, and it is a 'must visit' for anyone who enjoys looking at and learning about prehistoric art. Parking easy, a good restaurant and a good museum shop.Read more

Comment: Just 2 kilometers from Santillana del Mar, this complex is a good introduction to prehistoric times with easy to understand displays. To preserve the original cave and it's priceless artifacts, a neo cave has been created. If you haven't had the opportunity to visit a prehistoric cave, then this is a good introduction to life in the caves in Northern Spain, but the lighting and walkway take away from the real experience - great for children. You will be allocated a time to visit the cave when you buy your ticket.Overall the museum and displays are easy to understand in Spanish and English and well laid out. Only €3 for adults and free for seniors.Read more

Comment: We travelled up from Burgos to Altamira caves today. We have been to the Lascaux caves before, and the same issues apply: how public money is spent to preserve a natural wonder like this and still give maximum access to the public. I don't really know the answer. This is very well done as an educational experience for children, and there were lots of kids here and they seemed to love it. As adults I think it was lacking a lot.I don't think I would have made the trip if I had known in advance what it would be.On this trip we have been to the Valporquero caves and we went to the Evolution museum in Burgos yesterday, we really loved both these experiences, to put Altamira into context. I would certainly take children, but I don't think I'd suggest adults to go on their own as a special trip.Read more

Comment: I've been wanting to see one of the prehistoric caves in Europe and as we were close to this one, we made it part of our itinerary. I'm glad we did! My Rough Guide didn't think much of it because the cave itself is closed to visitors, but the museum provides an excellent reconstruction of one of the main chambers of the cave in the museum itself, and keeping visitor numbers down in the actual cave will go a long way towards protecting the originals. I thought it was well worth the experience. The museum has a great exhibit on the context of the caves and on prehistoric art, with lots of informative and interactive displays. The reconstructed cave is a timed entry for small groups at a time, and was a great experience. They provide a brochure to help you orient yourself with the paintings, and provide displays on the archaeology and daily life of the caves. I found the whole experience to be quite worthwhile, everything is signed in Spanish and English.They have great videos showing how the cave was reconstructed, with good information on WHY you should NOT go into original caves because of the damage masses of humans cause to them. As an archaeologist and someone who is invested in preserving cultural heritage, I found this to be a very helpful approach and hope that people understand and appreciate the effort of digitally and manually reproducing ancient artwork like this so that everyone can enjoy the marvels of the prehistoric era.There is a park set up around the original cave and museum, and you can walk on paths to where you can see the entrance to the original cave. Better signing here would have been nice.Read more

Comment: Prior to the discovery of the Altamira caves in the late 1800's, it was believed that prehistoric humans were incapable of artistic expression.  The discovery of Altamira turned this belief on its head.  Research has shown these ancient depictions of bison, deer, horses and other animals, as well as negative impressions of the prehistoric artists' hands, to range from 14,000 to 20,000 years ago, for the most part, with one rendering having been recently dated to 35,600 years ago!  Once opened to the public, these caves became increasingly popular, to the point that carbon dioxide emissions from the many visitors began to cause deterioration of the paintings.  Fearing the worst, the Spanish government closed the caves to the public in 1977 and only allowed limited access starting in 1982.  This led to a three-year waiting list for admission, so the Spanish government undertook an unprecedented project by recreating the caves and drawings for visits by the general public; the replica opened in 2001.  This project is remarkable!  If you did not know that you were in a reproduction, you would think you were in the actual Altamira cave itself.  The feeling, look and experience is that of seeing the original.  Don't be put off by other reviewers who complain about not being in the original cave!  The reproduced cave drawings were done using the same techniques and materials as the original artists of tens of thousands of years ago.  Ticket prices are very reasonable, but in busy tourist seasons, you may experience a wait.  Your ticket is for a specific time of admission.  If you have to wait, spend time in the museum before the cave instead of after.  The museum is excellent, with explanations in Spanish and English.  You'll learn a lot about ancient peoples and the section that explains how the duplicate cave was constructed is fascinating.  Bottom line, this is a not-to-be-missed visit if you are in northern Spain.  Great for kids, too!Read more

Comment: We thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating and educational experience helping us learn not only about the peoples that lived in these caves but also caves around the world over many millennia.What was most exciting is that one of our friends was picked from a lottery of early arrivers at the museum that Friday to go down into the actual caves and learn about the research underway to determine if the actual caves should be re-opened to the public. We learned a great deal from her, and she felt that the recreated cave was a perfect reproduction and actually easier to experience than the real cave so that was especially rewarding. I any case, the museum is really worth while although there are a fair number of places where the translation of explanations and information  to English is very limited. This must improve as they have more and more of an international audience.The lottery to allow five people to enter on Fridays will continue until sometime in the winter 2015 so if this is an exciting possibility, time your visit for a Friday. Some local aficionados go every Friday to try for this opportunity.Read more

Comment: You are limited access to give you a feeling of entering a cave.  A door slides open and 20 to 25 people enter to watch a brief silent movie to "prepare" you for what you will see.  you then enter a reproduction of actual cave with lots of artificial lighting. along the way are small video stations that explain what tools and how art was made.  You then move on to a hallway with life sized photos of the actual cave. There is a small area outside the active display area that has some interesting artifacts that have been uncovered in actual cave.I found the entire experience lacking in giving me any feeling for the actual artwork(which cannot  be seen) Reproduction was really only fair and Disney could do better.Read more

Comment: It's just a replica of just a bit of the original. The most convincing part is the physical shape of the cave - the cave mouth and the sloping floor. Some of the twenty or so replica paintings on the roof are hard to make out in the dim light, and so are the panels that are meant to help. It's gets quite low as you edge along the short walkway, almost claustrophobic, and it's a relief to get out. Apart from the replica bit of cave, there's an introduction room where you're shown a short video and a sort of museum room about prehistoric humanity in the area, plus of course a shop, selling  cards, toys and so on. Also a cafeteria, but it shuts early except in high summer. It could all do with a complete rethink. Maybe the people who designed the excellent  new archaeological museum in Oviedo could help.Read more

Comment: Unusually good signposting helped us to find the spacious car park, just outside Santellina Del Mar. There was a short walk to the ticket office, where a helpful lady spoke English. On to the exhibition hall where there was a wealth of exhibits, pictures and recreations (on TV screens) about all the different aspects of the lives of ancient people in the area. Each item had captions and text in English as well as Spanish. To view the replica cave, people go through in batches, according to the time on the ticket received at the ticket office. There is a short film (in Spanish) but then you take a downward path into the twilight world of the cave.  A mesmerising hologram/film shows a family in the cave. I had to watch it twice, in case I missed anything the first time. The path descends gently, passing various items showing the process of excavation, before levelling out under the cave roof. At this point I just marvelled at the beauty of these cave paintings and drawings. The artists had even taken the contours of the roof into account, positioning the picture, so that a natural protruberance in the rock might become the animal's shoulder or rump. I shuffled around with my head tilted back, unable to take my eyes off the stunning variety of images. Fortunately, no one chivvied us along to leave, even though other groups entered at the top.  That might change in high season though.It is all acessible and there is a very good gift shop and a little cafe/restaurant within the main building.  Our visit lasted about two and a half hours, including time for a cuppa, but could have been even longer.  All in all a definite 'must see' and with a visit to the town of Santillena Del Mar, it was a lovely day out.Read more

Comment: The famous Cave of Altamira and its prehistoric art is closed to the public for the protection of the artifacts.  On the site, however, is this wonderful Museum covering all of human prehistory, but concentrating on the period of the cave. The culmination of the museum is the "new cave," which is a full life size reproduction of the cave entrance as it was during human habitation (before cave ins severely restricted it) and the main chambers with all the art works faithfully reproduced.  It is a wonderful experience and well worth it for all ages.  Handicap access is available and this is an additional bonus.  This is not of course  the actual art on stone.  But neither is it a plastic replica  It is a well done accurate recreation of a World Cultural Heritage and certainly should be visited.Read more

Comment: The Museo de Altamira is wonderful. We spent about two hours there and I highly recommend this to everyone. The museum is extremely well done, all explanations in Spanish and English. The displays are artistic, interactive, and very very informative. The videos are great, too. Then there is the cave itself....Wow! Though this is not the actual cave, it is a perfect re-creation of the cave paintings and environment right down to the temperature and humidity of the real cave. It is so amazing, so well conceived and constructed that you feel as if you have visited the actual cave and witnessed these works of art in their ancient environment. It is a great experience. Don't miss it!Read more

Comment: Simply outstanding presentation of all aspects of the Altemira caves, with the replica cave as the highlight. Thoroughly bilingual in its presentation, with a mixture of presentation styles. Note that admission to the replica cave is by timed ticket.Read more

Comment: Having seen and loved the real Altamira years ago As an adolescent I was more than surprised to find such a stunning replica of rhe real cave. This ceiling was a bit higher, so this improved the viewing of the rock art especially the hands on the right of the rampant horse. Everything was so well organized and the attendants knowledgable answering in English, French, German and Spanish. The whole museum was a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to everybody.Another surprise was the price to get in: only 3 Euros and gratis for over 65.Read more

Comment: As many have said, it is very interesting and entertaining. the guided (in English) tour takes about 20 minutes while the exhibits take slightly longer. It is a nice side trip if you're also visiting Santillana del Mar and ComillasRead more

Comment: Very interesting museum and then vist to cave to look at cave paintings. This is a replica cave as they are trying to protect the real one from further damage and deterioration. Part of the museum exhibit explains this. Personally I think this is a good idea and the replica cave doesn't detract from the experience of being in the real cave.Read more

Comment: The only cave you can visit at Altamira is a replica so it is much better to go to the El Castillo cave nearby where you can see the actual cave art. El Castillo is a mile from Puente Viesgo (signposted from the village centre), due South of Santander. The cave is unspoilt and uncrowned but there are few facilities, so take your own food and drink. The cave paintings are fantastic and you can visit in small tour groups with a guide . An unforgettable experienceRead more

Comment: This museum houses a cave in which paintings belonging to the upper palaeolithic period. This means paintings made 35,000 years ago. It also houses artifacts left by their occupants on a period of 20,000 years. The fact that you can experience the immensity of these periods should be enough to give you chills.The sad part is that the cave was closed because the amount of visitors was affecting the cave. The good news is that they built a replica which is inch by inch a exact. Including the cracks in the rock and the stalactites. For the sake of conservation, I support the closing of the cave. They are still studying and discovering the cave. The museum is in excellent conditions and the expositions are well presented. Then you take a guided tour through the cave (replica) and explained all the paintings and the way the residents live. A must see. The only drawback is that even in the replica cave you can't take any pictures.Read more

Comment: The Altamira cave museum is well done, good presentation, almost all signs in English, good mix of interactive, static and video displays.  Small, but pleasant gift shop and cafe.  The replica caves are as if you're in the real deal, and nicely paced with small group spaced every few min.  Sunday is free (the good news) but also crowded (the bad news).  Stayed nearby in Santillana Del Mar -- a good choice!Read more

Comment: While the cave reproduction is good it is not impressive like that of Lascaux's in France's Dordogne.  Since you will only be able to visit the reproduction you may want to head over afterwards to Cave Castillo to experience originals and have the cave experience which is quite fun.My husband who has an avid interest in archealogy thought the museum was very well curated with good explanations in English.  For example the drawings are not of animals that we would have eaten in everyday life as one would think.Read more

Comment: I didn't know what I was for as I was just tagging along. What a magical experience. I won't ruin the magic, but the way the reproduction was done is part of the genius of this attraction for anyone who can score a behind the scenes look. Too bad Discovery Channel or National Geographic hadn't been invited to film a "making of" documentary. Kudos to the curator and the knowledgeable and multilingual staff. I'll be going back with the family. BTW - the museum has a program geared to kids and groups of kids.Read more
